 * already_AddRefed cooperates with reference counting smart pointers to enable
 * you to assign in a pointer _without_ |AddRef|ing it.  You might want to use
 * this as a return type from a function that returns an already |AddRef|ed
 * pointer.
 *
 * TODO Move already_AddRefed to namespace mozilla.  This has not yet been done
 * because of the sheer number of usages of already_AddRefed.
 *
 * When should you use already_AddRefed<>?
 * * Ensure a consumer takes ownership of a reference
 * * Pass ownership without calling AddRef/Release (sometimes required in
 *   off-main-thread code)
 * * The ref pointer type you're using doesn't support move construction
 *
 * Otherwise, use Move(RefPtr/nsCOMPtr/etc).

   * We want to allow returning nullptr from functions returning
   * already_AddRefed<T>, for simplicity.  But we also don't want to allow
   * returning raw T*, instead preferring creation of already_AddRefed<T> from
   * a reference counting smart pointer.
   *
   * We address the latter requirement by making the (T*) constructor explicit.
   * But |return nullptr| won't consider an explicit constructor, so we need
   * another constructor to handle it.  Plain old (decltype(nullptr)) doesn't
   * cut it, because if nullptr is emulated as __null (with type int or long),
   * passing nullptr to an int/long parameter triggers compiler warnings.  We
   * need a type that no one can pass accidentally; a pointer-to-member-function
   * (where no such function exists) does the trick nicely.
   *
   * That handles the return-value case.  What about for locals, argument types,
   * and so on?  |already_AddRefed<T>(nullptr)| considers both overloads (and
   * the (already_AddRefed<T>&&) overload as well!), so there's an ambiguity.
   * We can target true nullptr using decltype(nullptr), but we can't target
   * emulated nullptr the same way, because passing __null to an int/long
   * parameter triggers compiler warnings.  So just give up on this, and provide
   * this behavior through the default constructor.
   *
   * We can revert to simply explicit (T*) and implicit (decltype(nullptr)) when
   * nullptr no longer needs to be emulated to support the ancient b2g compiler.
   * (The () overload could also be removed, if desired, if we changed callers.)
