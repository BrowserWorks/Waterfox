/* A thread-safe weak pointer */

/**
 * Derive from SupportsThreadSafeWeakPtr to allow thread-safe weak pointers to
 * an atomically refcounted derived class. These thread-safe weak pointers may
 * be safely accessed and converted to strong pointers on multiple threads.
 *
 * Note that SupportsThreadSafeWeakPtr necessarily already inherits from
 * AtomicRefCounted, so you should not separately inherit from AtomicRefCounted.
 *
 * ThreadSafeWeakPtr and its implementation is distinct from the normal WeakPtr
 * which is not thread-safe. The interface discipline and implementation details
 * are different enough that these two implementations are separated for now for
 * efficiency reasons. If you don't actually need to use weak pointers on
 * multiple threads, you can just use WeakPtr instead.
 *
 * When deriving from SupportsThreadSafeWeakPtr, you should add
 * MOZ_DECLARE_THREADSAFEWEAKREFERENCE_TYPENAME(ClassName) and
 * MOZ_DECLARE_REFCOUNTED_TYPENAME(ClassName) to the public section of your
 * class, where ClassName is the name of your class.
 *
 * Example usage:
 *
 *   class C : public SupportsThreadSafeWeakPtr<C>
 *   {
 *   public:
 *     MOZ_DECLARE_THREADSAFEWEAKREFERENCE_TYPENAME(C)
 *     MOZ_DECLARE_REFCOUNTED_TYPENAME(C)
 *     void doStuff();
 *   };
 *
 *   ThreadSafeWeakPtr<C> weak;
 *   {
 *     RefPtr<C> strong = new C;
 *     if (strong) {
 *       strong->doStuff();
 *     }
 *     // Make a new weak reference to the object from the strong reference.
 *     weak = strong;
 *   }
 *   MOZ_ASSERT(!bool(weak), "Weak pointers are cleared after all "
 *                           "strong references are released.");
 *
 *   // Convert the weak reference to a strong reference for usage.
 *   RefPtr<C> other(weak);
 *   if (other) {
 *     other->doStuff();
 *   }
