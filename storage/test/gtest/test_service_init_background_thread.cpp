//// Test Functions

// HACK ALERT: this test fails if it runs after any of the other storage tests
// because the storage service will have been initialized and the
// do_GetService() call in ServiceInitializer::Run will succeed. So we need a
// way to force it to run before all the other storage gtests. As it happens,
// gtest has a concept of "death tests" that, among other things, run before
// all non-death tests. By merely using a "DeathTest" suffix here this becomes
// a death test -- even though it doesn't use any of the normal death test
// features -- which ensures this is the first storage test to run.
