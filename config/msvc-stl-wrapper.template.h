// looks to be full generation/mutation checked iterators as done by
// _GLIBCXX_DEBUG.  The latter appears to just be bounds checking, and
// is enabled by the following macros.  It appears that the _DEBUG
// iterators subsume _SECURE_SCL, and the following settings are
// default anyway, so we'll just leave this commented out.
//#  define _SECURE_SCL 1

//
// FIXME/bug 551254: because we're not wrapping all the STL headers we
// use, undefining this here can cause some headers to be built with
// iterator checking and others not.  Turning this off until we have a
