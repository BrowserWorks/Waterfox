fpush-linux-android:
    selector: fuzzy
    description: >-
        Runs correctness test suites on Linux and Android emulator platforms, as
        well as builds across main platforms. The resulting jobs on TreeHerder
        used to end up looking like a "F" shape (not so much these days) and so
        this is typically referred to as an F-push. This is useful to do as a
        general sanity check on changes to cross-platform Gecko code where you
        unsure of what tests might be affected. Linux and Android (emulator)
        test coverage are relatively cheap to run and cover a lot of the
        codebase, while the builds on other platforms catch compilation problems
        that might result from only building locally on one platform.
    query:
        - "'test-linux1804 'debug- !-shippable !-asan !-fis-"
        - "'test-android-em 'debug"
        - "^build !-shippable !-signing !-asan !-fuzzing !-rusttests !-base-toolchain !-aar-"

perf:
    selector: fuzzy
    description: >-
        Runs all performance (raptor and talos) tasks across all platforms.
        This preset can be filtered down further (e.g to limit it to a specific
        platform) via |mach try --preset perf -xq "'windows"|.

        Android hardware platforms are excluded due to resource limitations.
    query:
        - "^test- !android-hw 'raptor | 'talos"
    rebuild: 5

perf-chrome:
    description: >-
        Runs the talos tests most likely to change when making a change to
        the browser chrome. This skips a number of talos jobs that are unlikely
        to be affected in order to conserve resources.
    query:
        - "opt-talos- 'chrome | 'svg | 'session | 'tabswitch | 'other | 'g5"
    rebuild: 6
    selector: fuzzy

sample-suites:
    selector: fuzzy
    description: >-
        Runs one chunk of every test suite plus all suites that aren't chunked.
        It is useful for testing infrastructure changes that can affect the
        harnesses themselves but are unlikely to break specific tests.
    query:
        - ^test- -1$
        # Only run a single talos + raptor suite per platform
        - ^test- !1$ !2$ !3$ !4$ !5$ !6$ !7$ !8$ !9$ !0$ !raptor !talos

    description: <-
        Runs a set of tests aimed to give a reasonable level of confidence for
        basic SpiderMonkey changes, including those that would require a
        browser build.
