// This is a variant of AutoObjectMapperPOSIX suitable for use in
// conjunction with faulty.lib on Android.  How it behaves depends on
// the name of the file to be mapped.  There are three possible cases:
//
// (1) /foo/bar/xyzzy/blah.apk!/libwurble.so
//     We hand it as-is to faulty.lib and let it fish the relevant
//     bits out of the APK.
//
// (2) libmozglue.so
//     This is part of the Fennec installation, but is not in the
//     APK.  Instead we have to figure out the installation path
//     and look for it there.  Because of faulty.lib limitations,
//     we have to use regular open/mmap instead of faulty.lib.
//
// (3) libanythingelse.so
//     faulty.lib assumes this is a system library, and prepends
//     "/system/lib/" to the path.  So as in (1), we can give it
//     as-is to faulty.lib.
//
// Hence (1) and (3) require special-casing here.  Case (2) simply
// hands the problem to the parent class.
