  //   treat the thread as having slept a tiny bit longer than it really did.
  //
  // This latter inaccuracy could be avoided by moving the
  // CanDuplicateLastSampleDueToSleep() check within the thread-freezing code,
  // e.g. the section where Tick() is called. But that would reduce the
  // effectiveness of the optimization because more code would have to be run
  // before we can tell that duplication is allowed.

  // Therefore, we have the following two-step process.
  //
  // - The profiler requests (on-thread or off-thread) that the JS sampling be
  //   started/stopped, by changing mJSSampling to the appropriate REQUESTED
  //   state.
  //
  // - The relevant JS thread polls (on-thread) for changes to mJSSampling.
  //   When it sees a REQUESTED state, it performs the appropriate actions to
  //   actually start/stop JS sampling, and changes mJSSampling out of the
  //   REQUESTED state.
  //
  // The state machine is as follows.
  //
  //             INACTIVE --> ACTIVE_REQUESTED
  //                  ^       ^ |
  //                  |     _/  |

  //   INACTIVE_REQUESTED <-- ACTIVE
  //
  // The polling is done in the following two ways.
  //
  // - Via the interrupt callback mechanism; the JS thread must call
  //   profiler_js_interrupt_callback() from its own interrupt callback.
  //   This is how sampling must be started/stopped for threads where the
  //   request was made off-thread.
  //
  // - When {Start,Stop}JSSampling() is called on-thread, we can immediately
  //   follow it with a PollJSSampling() call to avoid the delay between the
  //   two steps. Likewise, setJSContext() calls PollJSSampling().
  //
  // One non-obvious thing about all this: these JS sampling requests are made
  // on all threads, even non-JS threads. mContext needs to also be set (via
  // setJSContext(), which can only happen for JS threads) for any JS sampling
  // to actually happen.
