    <!-- Some devices use resources based on configuration (e.g. large, xlarge) that are inconsistent
         with the configuration retrieved by HardwareUtils (e.g. some custom ROMs allow the user to
         choose a phone or tablet version of the UI even though the hardware stays the same). This
         can cause crashes when we branch on the value returned by HardwareUtils.

         In order to work around this, we define the resource size in resources with the expectation that
         we branch on that value, rather than HardwareUtils, so our code is consistent with the used resources.
         See bug 1277379 for a initiative to move all of the HardwareUtils code over. -->
