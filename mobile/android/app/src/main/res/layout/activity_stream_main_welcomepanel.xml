<!-- Viewstub requires a parent (since inflation involves removing the stub and replacing it with
     the new layout, hence we need this empty framelayout (we don't attach the welcomepanel
     to it's enclosing RecyclerView until after inflation - otherwise this issue wouldn't exist).
     In this case, we need a FrameLayout for animations to work correctly, it would originally have lived
     within welcomepanel_content, but this placing it here is just as good. -->
