<!--
DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!

This file is specifically designed to create a page larger than
any screen fennec could run on (to allow panning in both axes).
It is filled with 100x100 pixel boxes that are of unique colour,
so that we can identify exactly what part of the page we are
rendering at any given time. The colours are specifically chosen
so that adjacent boxes have a fairly large variation in colour,
and so that errors due to 565/888 conversion are minimised. This
is done by dropping the bottom few bits on each color channel,
so that conversion from 888->565 is pretty much lossless, and any
variation only comes in from however the drivers do 565->888.

A lot of the tests depend on this behaviour, so ensure that all
the tests pass (on a variety of screen sizes) when making any
changes to this file.
