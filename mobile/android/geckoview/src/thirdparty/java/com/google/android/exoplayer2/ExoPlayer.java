/**
 * An extensible media player exposing traditional high-level media player functionality, such as
 * the ability to buffer media, play, pause and seek. Instances can be obtained from
 * {@link ExoPlayerFactory}.
 *
 * <h3>Player composition</h3>
 * <p>ExoPlayer is designed to make few assumptions about (and hence impose few restrictions on) the
 * type of the media being played, how and where it is stored, and how it is rendered. Rather than
 * implementing the loading and rendering of media directly, ExoPlayer implementations delegate this
 * work to components that are injected when a player is created or when it's prepared for playback.
 * Components common to all ExoPlayer implementations are:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>A <b>{@link MediaSource}</b> that defines the media to be played, loads the media, and from
 *   which the loaded media can be read. A MediaSource is injected via {@link #prepare} at the start
 *   of playback. The library modules provide default implementations for regular media files
 *   ({@link ExtractorMediaSource}), DASH (DashMediaSource), SmoothStreaming (SsMediaSource) and HLS
 *   (HlsMediaSource), implementations for merging ({@link MergingMediaSource}) and concatenating
 *   ({@link ConcatenatingMediaSource}) other MediaSources, and an implementation for loading single
 *   samples ({@link SingleSampleMediaSource}) most often used for side-loaded subtitle and closed
 *   caption files.</li>
 *   <li><b>{@link Renderer}</b>s that render individual components of the media. The library
 *   provides default implementations for common media types ({@link MediaCodecVideoRenderer},
 *   {@link MediaCodecAudioRenderer}, {@link TextRenderer} and {@link MetadataRenderer}). A Renderer
 *   consumes media of its corresponding type from the MediaSource being played. Renderers are
 *   injected when the player is created.</li>
 *   <li>A <b>{@link TrackSelector}</b> that selects tracks provided by the MediaSource to be
 *   consumed by each of the available Renderers. The library provides a default implementation
 *   ({@link DefaultTrackSelector}) suitable for most use cases. A TrackSelector is injected when
 *   the player is created.</li>
 *   <li>A <b>{@link LoadControl}</b> that controls when the MediaSource buffers more media, and how
 *   much media is buffered. The library provides a default implementation
 *   ({@link DefaultLoadControl}) suitable for most use cases. A LoadControl is injected when the
 *   player is created.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>An ExoPlayer can be built using the default components provided by the library, but may also
 * be built using custom implementations if non-standard behaviors are required. For example a
 * custom LoadControl could be injected to change the player's buffering strategy, or a custom
 * Renderer could be injected to use a video codec not supported natively by Android.
 *
 * <p>The concept of injecting components that implement pieces of player functionality is present
 * throughout the library. The default component implementations listed above delegate work to
 * further injected components. This allows many sub-components to be individually replaced with
 * custom implementations. For example the default MediaSource implementations require one or more
 * {@link DataSource} factories to be injected via their constructors. By providing a custom factory
 * it's possible to load data from a non-standard source or through a different network stack.
 *
 * <h3>Threading model</h3>
 * <p>The figure below shows ExoPlayer's threading model.</p>
 * <p align="center">
 *   <img src="doc-files/exoplayer-threading-model.svg" alt="ExoPlayer's threading model">
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>It is recommended that ExoPlayer instances are created and accessed from a single application
 * thread. The application's main thread is ideal. Accessing an instance from multiple threads is
 * discouraged, however if an application does wish to do this then it may do so provided that it
 * ensures accesses are synchronized.</li>
 * <li>Registered listeners are called on the thread that created the ExoPlayer instance.</li>
 * <li>An internal playback thread is responsible for playback. Injected player components such as
 * Renderers, MediaSources, TrackSelectors and LoadControls are called by the player on this
 * thread.</li>
 * <li>When the application performs an operation on the player, for example a seek, a message is
 * delivered to the internal playback thread via a message queue. The internal playback thread
 * consumes messages from the queue and performs the corresponding operations. Similarly, when a
 * playback event occurs on the internal playback thread, a message is delivered to the application
 * thread via a second message queue. The application thread consumes messages from the queue,
 * updating the application visible state and calling corresponding listener methods.</li>
 * <li>Injected player components may use additional background threads. For example a MediaSource
 * may use a background thread to load data. These are implementation specific.</li>
 * </ul>
