/**
 * Maintains state of add-ons.
 *
 * State is maintained in 2 data structures, an object mapping add-on IDs
 * to metadata and an array of changes over time. The object mapping can be
 * thought of as a minimal copy of data from AddonManager which is needed for
 * Sync. The array is effectively a log of changes over time.
 *
 * The data structures are persisted to disk by serializing to a JSON file in
 * the current profile. The data structures are updated by 2 mechanisms. First,
 * they can be refreshed from the global state of the AddonManager. This is a
 * sure-fire way of ensuring the reconciler is up to date. Second, the
 * reconciler adds itself as an AddonManager listener. When it receives change
 * notifications, it updates its internal state incrementally.
 *
 * The internal state is persisted to a JSON file in the profile directory.
 *
 * An instance of this is bound to an AddonsEngine instance. In reality, it
 * likely exists as a singleton. To AddonsEngine, it functions as a store and
 * an entity which emits events for tracking.
 *
 * The usage pattern for instances of this class is:
 *
 *   let reconciler = new AddonsReconciler();
 *   reconciler.loadState(null, function(error) { ... });
 *
 *   // At this point, your instance should be ready to use.
 *
 * When you are finished with the instance, please call:
 *
 *   reconciler.stopListening();
 *   reconciler.saveState(...);
 *
 * There are 2 classes of listeners in the AddonManager: AddonListener and
 * InstallListener. This class is a listener for both (member functions just
 * get called directly).
 *
 * When an add-on is installed, listeners are called in the following order:
 *
 *  IL.onInstallStarted, AL.onInstalling, IL.onInstallEnded, AL.onInstalled
 *
 * For non-restartless add-ons, an application restart may occur between
 * IL.onInstallEnded and AL.onInstalled. Unfortunately, Sync likely will
 * not be loaded when AL.onInstalled is fired shortly after application
 * start, so it won't see this event. Therefore, for add-ons requiring a
 * restart, Sync treats the IL.onInstallEnded event as good enough to
 * indicate an install. For restartless add-ons, Sync assumes AL.onInstalled
 * will follow shortly after IL.onInstallEnded and thus it ignores
 * IL.onInstallEnded.
 *
 * The listeners can also see events related to the download of the add-on.
 * This class isn't interested in those. However, there are failure events,
 * IL.onDownloadFailed and IL.onDownloadCanceled which get called if a
 * download doesn't complete successfully.
 *
 * For uninstalls, we see AL.onUninstalling then AL.onUninstalled. Like
 * installs, the events could be separated by an application restart and Sync
 * may not see the onUninstalled event. Again, if we require a restart, we
 * react to onUninstalling. If not, we assume we'll get onUninstalled.
 *
 * Enabling and disabling work by sending:
 *
 *   AL.onEnabling, AL.onEnabled
 *   AL.onDisabling, AL.onDisabled
 *
 * Again, they may be separated by a restart, so we heed the requiresRestart
 * flag.
 *
 * Actions can be undone. All undoable actions notify the same
 * AL.onOperationCancelled event. We treat this event like any other.
 *
 * Restartless add-ons have interesting behavior during uninstall. These
 * add-ons are first disabled then they are actually uninstalled. So, we will
 * see AL.onDisabling and AL.onDisabled. The onUninstalling and onUninstalled
 * events only come after the Addon Manager is closed or another view is
 * switched to. In the case of Sync performing the uninstall, the uninstall
 * events will occur immediately. However, we still see disabling events and
 * heed them like they were normal. In the end, the state is proper.
