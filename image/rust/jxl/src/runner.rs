//! Spreads one JXL decode's work across a thread pool dedicated to JXL decoding.
//!
//! # Why a pool of our own
//!
//! The helpers run on a different pool from the decode itself, which is what
//! makes waiting here safe: the thread that blocks and the threads it waits on
//! belong to different pools, so a blocked decode can never be holding a thread
//! that a helper needs. An AVIF decode does the same thing, fanning out to
//! dav1d's own threads.
//!
//! The pool is a `SharedThreadPool`, so it costs nothing until the first
//! parallel decode in the process, it is shut down for us at
//! xpcom-shutdown-threads, and its threads are reaped once they go idle.
//!
//! # Why the closure's lifetime is erased
//!
//! The closure jxl-rs hands us borrows its decode state, so it is only valid for
//! the duration of the call. A helper is an `nsIRunnable`, which has to be
//! `'static`. Both cannot be true, so the lifetime is transmuted away and the
//! closure travels behind a raw pointer.
//!
//! What puts the guarantee back is that the call does not return until every
//! helper it queued has been accounted for. `Helper` decrements the outstanding
//! count from its `Drop`, which runs whether the helper ran or was thrown away
//! without running, and `WaitForHelpers` blocks until that count is zero.
//!
//! `WaitForHelpers` does its waiting from a destructor rather than from a
//! statement after the work, so it also covers the calling thread's own
//! invocation of the closure panicking, which would otherwise unwind past the
//! wait and leave helpers dereferencing a closure jxl-rs has taken back. Gecko
//! builds Rust with `panic=abort` so that unwind does not arise in Firefox, but
//! rusttests builds with unwinding.
//!
//! Helpers are dispatched with `DISPATCH_FALLIBLE`, which asks the pool to
//! release a helper it cannot queue instead of leaking it, so a failed dispatch
//! runs the `Drop` as well.
//!
//! # What this asks of the pool
//!
//! This depends on a queued helper eventually either running or being released,
//! since the wait is for its payload's destructor. `nsThreadPool` has that
//! property: its threads drain the queue to empty before exiting, even once it
//! is shutting down, and `Shutdown` joins them.
