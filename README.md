The Waterfox source code is a specialised modification of the Mozilla platform, designed for privacy and user choice in mind. You should be able to
install it and compile Waterfox without any issues. Other modifications and patches that are more
upstream have been implemented as well to fix any compatibility/security issues that Mozilla may 
lag behind in implementing (usually due to not being high priority). High request features removed by Mozilla but wanted by users are retained (if they aren't removed due to security).

### Features


* Compiled with Clang-cl on Windows, Clang+LLVM on Linux
* Disabled Encrypted Media Extensions (EME)
