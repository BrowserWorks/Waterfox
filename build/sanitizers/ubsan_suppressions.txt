# This list contains runtime suppression entries for any issues reported
# by UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer (UBSan). Unlike the compile-time blacklists,
# this list allows us to blacklist source code files and functions only for
# specific checks performed by UBSan.
#
# Example:
#
# signed-integer-overflow:file-with-known-overflow.cpp
# alignment:function_doing_unaligned_access
# vptr:shared_object_with_vptr_failures.so
#
# Since runtime suppressions are much more expensive than compile-time
# blacklisting, this list should not be used for frequent issues but rather
# only for sporadic warnings that have already been checked and confirmed
# to not be bugs.
