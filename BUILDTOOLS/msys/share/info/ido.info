1 Overview
**********

This document describes a set of features that can interactively do
things with buffers and files.  All the features are described here in
detail.

   The "Ido" package can let you switch between buffers and visit files
and directories with a minimum of keystrokes.  It is a superset of
Iswitchb, the interactive buffer switching package by Stephen Eglen.

   This package was originally written by Kim F. Storm, based on the
`iswitchb.el' package by Stephen Eglen.

* Menu:

* Activation::                  How to use this package.
* Working Directories::         Where files have most recently been opened.


File: ido.info,  Node: Activation,  Next: Working Directories,  Up: Overview

1.1 Activation
==============

This package is distributed with Emacs, so there is no need to install
any additional files in order to start using it.  To activate, use `M-x
ido-mode'.

You may wish to add the following expressions to your initialization
file (*note The Emacs Initialization File: (emacs)Init File.), if you
make frequent use of features from this package.

     (require 'ido)
     (ido-mode t)


File: ido.info,  Node: Working Directories,  Prev: Activation,  Up: Overview

1.2 Working Directories
=======================

"Working directories" are directories where files have most recently
been opened.  The current directory is inserted at the front of this
`ido-work-directory-list' whenever a file is opened with
`ido-find-file' and other file-related functions.

 -- User Option: ido-max-work-directory-list
     This user option specifies maximum number of working directories to
     record.

 -- User Option: ido-max-dir-file-cache
     This user option specifies maximum number of working directories
     to be cached.  This is the size of the cache of
     `file-name-all-completions' results.  Each cache entry is time
     stamped with the modification time of the directory.  Some systems,
     like MS-Windows, have unreliable directory modification times, so
     you may choose to disable caching on such systems, or explicitly
     refresh the cache contents using the command `ido-reread-directory'
     (usually `C-l') in the minibuffer.

2 Matching
**********

This section describes features of this package that have to do with
various kinds of _matching_: among buffers, files, and directories.

* Menu:

* Interactive Substring Matching::  Interactivity, matching, scrolling.
* Prefix Matching::             Standard completion.
* Flexible Matching::           More flexible matching.
* Regexp Matching::             Matching using regular expression.


File: ido.info,  Node: Interactive Substring Matching,  Next: Prefix Matching,  Up: Matching

2.1 Interactive Substring Matching
==================================

As you type in a substring, the list of buffers or files currently
matching the substring are displayed as you type.  The list is ordered
so that the most recent buffers or files visited come at the start of
the list.

   The buffer or file at the start of the list will be the one visited
when you press <RET>.  By typing more of the substring, the list is
narrowed down so that gradually the buffer or file you want will be at
the top of the list.  Alternatively, you can use `C-s' and `C-r' (or
the right and left arrow keys) to rotate buffer or file names in the
list until the one you want is at the top of the list.

   Completion is also available so that you can see what is common to
all of the matching buffers or files as you type.

   For example, if there are two buffers called `123456' and `123',
with `123456' the most recent, when using `ido-switch-buffer', you
first of all get presented with the list of all the buffers

     Buffer: {123456 | 123}

   If you then press `2':

     Buffer: 2[3]{123456 | 123}

   The list in {...} are the matching buffers, most recent first
(buffers visible in the current frame are put at the end of the list by
default).  At any time you can select the item at the head of the list
by pressing <RET>.  You can also put the first element at the end of
the list by pressing `C-s' or `<right>', or bring the last element to
the head of the list by pressing `C-r' or `<left>'.

   The item in [...] indicates what can be added to your input by
pressing <TAB> (`ido-complete').  In this case, you will get "3" added
to your input.

   So, press <TAB>:

     Buffer: 23{123456 | 123}

   At this point, you still have two matching buffers.  If you want the
first buffer in the list, you can simply press <RET>.  If you want the
second in the list, you can press `C-s' to move it to the top of the
list and then press <RET> to select it.

   However, if you type `4', you'll only have one match left:

     Buffer: 234[123456]

   Since there is only one matching buffer left, it is given in [] and
it is shown in the `ido-only-match' face (ForestGreen).  You can now
press <TAB> or <RET> to go to that buffer.

   If you want to create a new buffer named `234', you can press `C-j'
(`ido-select-text') instead of <TAB> or <RET>.

   If instead, you type `a':

     Buffer: 234a [No match]

   There are no matching buffers.  If you press <RET> or <TAB>, you can
be prompted to create a new buffer called `234a'.

   Of course, where this function comes in really useful is when you can
specify the buffer using only a few keystrokes.  In the above example,
the quickest way to get to the `123456' file would be just to type `4'
and then <RET> (assuming there isn't any newer buffer with `4' in its
name).

   Likewise, if you use `C-x C-f' (`ido-find-file'), the list of files
and directories in the current directory is provided in the same
fashion as the buffers above.  The files and directories are normally
sorted in alphabetical order, but the most recently visited directory
is placed first to speed up navigating to directories that you have
visited recently.

   In addition to scrolling through the list using `<right>' and
`<left>', you can use `<up>' and `<down>' to quickly scroll the list to
the next or previous subdirectory.

   To go down into a subdirectory, and continue the file selection on
the files in that directory, simply move the directory to the head of
the list and hit <RET>.

   To go up to the parent directory, delete any partial file name
already specified (e.g. using <DEL>) and hit <DEL>.

   To go to the root directory (on the current drive), enter two
slashes.  On MS-DOS or Windows, to select the root of another drive,
enter `X:/' where `X' is the drive letter.  To go to the home
directory, enter `~/'.  To enter Dired for this directory, use `C-d'.

   You can also visit files on other hosts using the ange-ftp notations
`/host:' and `/user@host:'.

   You can type `M-p' and `M-n' to change to previous/next directories
from the history, `M-s' to search for a file matching your input, and
`M-k' to remove the current directory from the history.

   If for some reason you cannot specify the proper file using
`ido-find-file', you can press `C-f' to enter the normal `find-file'.
You can also press `C-b' to drop into `ido-switch-buffer'.


File: ido.info,  Node: Prefix Matching,  Next: Flexible Matching,  Prev: Interactive Substring Matching,  Up: Matching

2.2 Prefix Matching
===================

The standard way of completion with *nix shells and Emacs is to insert
a "prefix" and then hitting <TAB> (or another completion key).  Cause
of this behavior has become second nature to a lot of Emacs users Ido
offers in addition to the default substring matching method (look
above) also the prefix matching method.  The kind of matching is the
only difference to the description of the substring matching above.

   You can toggle prefix matching with `C-p' (`ido-toggle-prefix').

   For example, if you have two buffers `123456' and `123' then hitting
`2' does not match because `2' is not a prefix in any of the buffer
names.


File: ido.info,  Node: Flexible Matching,  Next: Regexp Matching,  Prev: Prefix Matching,  Up: Matching

2.3 Flexible Matching
=====================

 -- User Option: ido-enable-flex-matching
     If non-`nil', Ido will do flexible string matching.  Flexible
     matching means that if the entered string does not match any item,
     any item containing the entered characters in the given sequence
     will match.

If `ido-enable-flex-matching' is non-`nil', Ido will do a more flexible
matching (unless regexp matching is active) to find possible matches
among the available buffer or file names if no matches are found using
the normal prefix or substring matching.

   The flexible matching implies that any item which simply contains all
of the entered characters in the specified sequence will match.

   For example, if you have four files `alpha', `beta', `gamma', and
`delta', entering `aa' will match `alpha' and `gamma', while `ea'
matches `beta' and `delta'.  If prefix matching is also active, `aa'
only matches `alpha', while `ea' does not match any files.


File: ido.info,  Node: Regexp Matching,  Prev: Flexible Matching,  Up: Matching

2.4 Regular Expression Matching
===============================

There is limited provision for regexp matching within Ido, enabled
through `ido-enable-regexp' (toggle with `C-t').  This allows you to
type `[ch]$' for example and see all file names ending in `c' or `h'.

 -- User Option: ido-enable-regexp
     If the value of this user option is non-`nil', Ido will do regexp
     matching.  The value of this user option can be toggled within
     ido-mode using `ido-toggle-regexp'.

   *Please notice:* Ido-style completion is inhibited when you enable
regexp matching.


File: ido.info,  Node: Highlighting,  Next: Hidden Buffers and Files,  Prev: Matching,  Up: Top

3 Highlighting
**************

The highlighting of matching items is controlled via `ido-use-faces'.
The faces used are `ido-first-match', `ido-only-match' and `ido-subdir'.

   Coloring of the matching item was suggested by Carsten Dominik.


File: ido.info,  Node: Hidden Buffers and Files,  Next: Customization,  Prev: Highlighting,  Up: Top

4 Hidden Buffers and Files
**************************

Normally, Ido does not include hidden buffers (whose name starts with a
space) and hidden files and directories (whose name starts with `.') in
the list of possible completions.  However, if the substring you enter
does not match any of the visible buffers or files, Ido will
automatically look for completions among the hidden buffers or files.

   You can toggle display of the hidden buffers and files with `C-a'
(`ido-toggle-ignore').


File: ido.info,  Node: Customization,  Next: Misc,  Prev: Hidden Buffers and Files,  Up: Top

5 Customization
***************

You can customize the `ido' group to change Ido functionality:

     M-x customize-group RET ido RET

or customize a certain variable:

     M-x customize-variable RET ido-xxxxx

   To modify the keybindings, use the `ido-setup-hook'.  For example:

     (add-hook 'ido-setup-hook 'ido-my-keys)

     (defun ido-my-keys ()
      "Add my keybindings for Ido."
      (define-key ido-completion-map " " 'ido-next-match))

* Menu:

* Changing List Order::         Changing the list of files.
* Find File At Point::          Make Ido guess the context.
* Ignoring::                    Ignorance is bliss.
* Misc Customization::          Miscellaneous customization for Ido.


File: ido.info,  Node: Changing List Order,  Next: Find File At Point,  Up: Customization

5.1 Changing List Order
=======================

By default, the list of current files is most recent first, oldest
last, with the exception that the files visible in the current frame
are put at the end of the list.  A hook exists to allow other functions
to order the list.  For example, if you add:

     (add-hook 'ido-make-buffer-list-hook 'ido-summary-buffers-to-end)

then all files matching "Summary" are moved to the end of the list.  (I
find this handy for keeping the INBOX Summary and so on out of the
way.)  It also moves files matching `output\*$' to the end of the list
(these are created by AUCTeX when compiling.)  Other functions could be
made available which alter the list of matching files (either deleting
or rearranging elements.)


File: ido.info,  Node: Find File At Point,  Next: Ignoring,  Prev: Changing List Order,  Up: Customization

5.2 Find File At Point
======================

Find File At Point, also known generally as "ffap", is an intelligent
system for opening files, and URLs.

   The following expression will make Ido guess the context:

     (setq ido-use-filename-at-point 'guess)

   You can disable URL ffap support by toggling `ido-use-url-at-point'.

 -- User Option: ido-use-url-at-point
     If the value of this user option is non-`nil', Ido will look for a
     URL at point.  If found, call `find-file-at-point' to visit it.


File: ido.info,  Node: Ignoring,  Next: Misc Customization,  Prev: Find File At Point,  Up: Customization

5.3 Ignoring Buffers and Files
==============================

Ido is capable of ignoring buffers, directories, files and extensions
using regular expression.

 -- User Option: ido-ignore-buffers
     This variable takes a list of regular expressions for buffers to
     ignore in `ido-switch-buffer'.

 -- User Option: ido-ignore-directories
     This variable takes a list of regular expressions for
     (sub)directories names to ignore in `ido-dired' and
     `ido-find-file'.

 -- User Option: ido-ignore-files
     This variable takes a list of regular expressions for files to
     ignore in `ido-find-file'.

 -- User Option: ido-ignore-unc-host-regexps
     This variable takes a list of regular expressions matching UNC
     hosts to ignore.  The letter case will be ignored if
     `ido-downcase-unc-hosts' is non-`nil'.

   To make Ido use `completion-ignored-extensions' you need to enable
it:

     (setq ido-ignore-extensions t)

   Now you can customize `completion-ignored-extensions' as well.  Go
ahead and add all the useless object files, backup files, shared
library files and other computing flotsam you don't want Ido to show.

   *Please notice:* Ido will still complete the ignored elements if it
would otherwise not show any other matches.  So if you type out the
name of an ignored file, Ido will still let you open it just fine.


File: ido.info,  Node: Misc Customization,  Prev: Ignoring,  Up: Customization

5.4 Miscellaneous Customization
===============================

 -- User Option: ido-mode
     This user option determines for which functional group (buffer and
     files) Ido behavior should be enabled.

 -- User Option: ido-case-fold
     If the value of this user option is non-`nil', searching of buffer
     and file names should ignore case.

 -- User Option: ido-show-dot-for-dired
     If the value of this user option is non-`nil', always put `.'  as
     the first item in file name lists.  This allows the current
     directory to be opened immediately with Dired

 -- User Option: ido-enable-dot-prefix
     If the value of this user option is non-`nil', Ido will match
     leading dot as prefix.  I.e., hidden files and buffers will match
     only if you type a dot as first char (even if `ido-enable-prefix'
     is `nil').

 -- User Option: ido-confirm-unique-completion
     If the value of this user option is non-`nil', even a unique
     completion must be confirmed.  This means that `ido-complete'
     (<TAB>) must always be followed by `ido-exit-minibuffer' (<RET>)
     even when there is only one unique completion.

 -- User Option: ido-cannot-complete-command
     When `ido-complete' can't complete any more, it will run the
     command specified by this user option.  The most useful values are
     `ido-completion-help', which pops up a window with completion
     alternatives, or `ido-next-match' or `ido-prev-match', which cycle
     the buffer list.

 -- User Option: ido-max-file-prompt-width
     This user option specifies the upper limit of the prompt string.
     If its value is an integer, it specifies the number of characters
     of the string.  If its value is a floating point number, it
     specifies a fraction of the frame width.

 -- User Option: ido-max-window-height
     If the value of this user option is non-`nil', its value will
     override the variable `max-mini-window-height', which is the
     maximum height for resizing mini-windows (the minibuffer and the
     echo area).  If it's a floating point number, it specifies a
     fraction of the mini-window frame's height.  If it's an integer,
     it specifies the number of lines.

 -- User Option: ido-record-commands
     If the value of this user option is non-`nil', Ido will record
     commands in the variable `command-history'.  Note that non-Ido
     equivalent is recorded.

 -- User Option: ido-all-frames
     This user option will be passed to `walk-windows' as its
     ALL-FRAMES argument when Ido is finding buffers.  *Note Cyclic
     Ordering of Windows: (elisp)Cyclic Window Ordering.

 -- User Option: ido-minibuffer-setup-hook
     This hook variable contains Ido-specific customization of
     minibuffer setup.  It is run during minibuffer setup if Ido is
     active, and is intended for use in customizing ido for
     interoperation with other packages.

6 Miscellaneous
***************

After `C-x b' (`ido-switch-buffer'), the buffer at the head of the list
can be killed by pressing `C-k'.  If the buffer needs saving, you will
be queried before the buffer is killed.

   Likewise, after `C-x C-f', you can delete (i.e., physically remove)
the file at the head of the list with `C-k'.  You will always be asked
for confirmation before deleting the file.

   If you enter `C-x b' to switch to a buffer visiting a given file,
and you find that the file you are after is not in any buffer, you can
press `C-f' to immediately drop into `ido-find-file'.  And you can
switch back to buffer selection with `C-b'.

   You can also use Ido in your Emacs Lisp programs:

     (setq my-pkgs (list "CEDET" "Gnus" "Rcirc" "Tramp" "Org" "all-of-them"))
     (ido-completing-read "What's your favorite package? " my-pkgs)

* Menu:

* All Matching::                Seeing all the matching buffers or files.
* Replacement::                 Replacement for `read-buffer' and `read-file-name'.
* Other Packages::              Don't want to depend on `ido-everywhere'?


File: ido.info,  Node: All Matching,  Next: Replacement,  Up: Misc

6.1 All Matching
================

If you have many matching files, they may not all fit onto one line of
the minibuffer.  Normally, the minibuffer window will grow to show you
more of the matching files (depending on the value of the variables
`resize-mini-windows' and `max-mini-window-height').  If you want Ido
to behave differently from the default minibuffer resizing behavior,
set the variable `ido-max-window-height'.

   Also, to improve the responsiveness of Ido, the maximum number of
matching items is limited to 12, but you can increase or removed this
limit via the `ido-max-prospects' user option.

   To see a full list of all matching buffers in a separate buffer, hit
`?' or press <TAB> when there are no further completions to the
substring.  Repeated <TAB> presses will scroll you through this
separate buffer.


File: ido.info,  Node: Replacement,  Next: Other Packages,  Prev: All Matching,  Up: Misc

6.2 Replacement
===============

`ido-read-buffer' and `ido-read-file-name' have been written to be drop
in replacements for the normal buffer and file name reading functions
`read-buffer' and `read-file-name'.

   To use ido for all buffer and file selections in Emacs, customize the
variable `ido-everywhere'.


File: ido.info,  Node: Other Packages,  Prev: Replacement,  Up: Misc

6.3 Other Packages
==================

If you don't want to rely on the `ido-everywhere' functionality,
`ido-read-buffer', `ido-read-file-name', and `ido-read-directory-name'
can be used by other packages to read a buffer name, a file name, or a
directory name in the _Ido_ way.

     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
     and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from
     you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and
     not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of
     the same material does not give you any rights to use it.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy
     can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

 11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
