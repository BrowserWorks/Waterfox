1.1 Why support GNU Emacs on Windows?
=====================================

It is not our goal to "help Windows users" by making text editing on
Windows more convenient.  We aim to replace proprietary software, not
to enhance it.  So why support GNU Emacs on Windows?

   We hope that the experience of using GNU Emacs on Windows will give
programmers a taste of freedom, and that this will later inspire them
to move to a free operating system such as GNU/Linux.  That is the main
valid reason to support free applications on nonfree operating systems.


File: efaq-w32.info,  Node: Which versions of Windows,  Next: Other versions of Emacs,  Prev: Why Emacs on Windows,  Up: Introduction

1.2 Which versions of Windows are supported?
============================================

Emacs 24.4 is known to run on all versions of Windows from Windows 98
and Windows NT 4.0 through to Windows 7.  The Windows port is built
using the Win32 API and supports most features of the X version,
including variable width fonts, images and tooltips.


File: efaq-w32.info,  Node: Other versions of Emacs,  Prev: Which versions of Windows,  Up: Introduction

1.3 What other versions of Emacs run on Windows?
================================================

*Note Cygwin::.

   Emacs can also be compiled for MSDOS.  When run on recent MS Windows,
it supports long file names, and uses the Windows clipboard.  See the
`msdos' directory in the Emacs sources for building instructions
(requires DJGPP).

File: efaq-w32.info,  Node: Downloading,  Next: Compiling,  Up: Getting Emacs

2.1 Where can I download Emacs?
===============================

Pre-compiled versions are distributed from ftp.gnu.org mirrors
(http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/emacs/windows/).  Emacs binaries are
distributed as zip files, digitally signed by the developer who built
them.  Generally most users will want the file
`emacs-24.4-bin-i386.zip', which contains everything you need to get
started.

   The latest source is available from ftp.gnu.org mirrors
(http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/emacs/).  It is distributed as a compressed
tar file, digitally signed by the maintainer who made the release.

   The development version of Emacs is available from Savannah
(http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/emacs), the GNU development site.


File: efaq-w32.info,  Node: Compiling,  Next: Debugging,  Prev: Downloading,  Up: Getting Emacs

2.2 How can I compile Emacs myself?
===================================

To compile Emacs on Windows, you will need the MingW or Cygwin port of
GCC with MingW make, or a Microsoft C compiler with nmake and the
single threaded C runtime library.  Recent versions of Microsoft Visual
Studio no longer come with the single threaded C runtime library, which
is required for certain POSIX compatibility, so MingW is usually the
best choice.  Image support requires external libraries, the headers
and import libraries for which will need to be installed where your
compiler can find them.  You will also need ports of GNU `rm' and `cp',
as the Windows native equivalents are not consistent between versions.
GNU texinfo will be required to build the manuals.  *Note Other useful
ports::.

   After unpacking the source, or checking out of Bzr, be sure to read
the instructions in `nt/README' and `nt/INSTALL'.


File: efaq-w32.info,  Node: Debugging,  Prev: Compiling,  Up: Getting Emacs

2.3 How do I use a debugger on Emacs?
=====================================

By default, Emacs is compiled with debugging on, and optimizations
enabled.  The optimizations may interfere with some types of debugging;
the debugger may not show clearly where it is, or may not be able to
inspect certain variables.  If this is the case, reconfigure with
`--no-opt'.

   The file `etc/DEBUG' contains general debugging hints, as well as
specific notes about debugging Emacs with both gdb and Microsoft
debuggers.

* Menu:

* GDB::
* Microsoft Developer Studio::


File: efaq-w32.info,  Node: GDB,  Next: Microsoft Developer Studio,  Up: Debugging

2.3.1 GDB
---------

GDB is the GNU debugger, which can be used to debug Emacs when it has
been compiled with GCC.  The best results will be obtained if you start
gdb from the `src' directory as `gdb oo/i386/emacs.exe'.  This will
load the init file `.gdbinit' in that directory, to define some extra
commands for working with lisp while debugging, and set up breakpoints
to catch abnormal aborts.


File: efaq-w32.info,  Node: Microsoft Developer Studio,  Prev: GDB,  Up: Debugging

2.3.2 Microsoft Developer Studio
--------------------------------

MS DevStudio can be used to debug Emacs when it has been compiled with
a Microsoft compiler.  To view lisp variables, you can call the
function `debug_print' from the Quickwatch window.  Some old tips
(http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/ntemacs/discuss/debug.txt)
are probably still valid.

File: efaq-w32.info,  Node: Unpacking,  Next: Installing,  Up: Installing Emacs

3.1 How do I unpack the distributions?
======================================

The binary distributions are distributed as zip files, which are handled
natively by Windows XP and later.  For earlier versions, there are many
tools that can handle the zip format, from InfoZip's command line unzip
tool, to 7zip's multi-format graphical archive explorer.  Although
popular, WinZip has caused problems with line-ends in the past, and is
not Free software, so we do not recommend it.

   Source distributions are distributed as gzipped tar files.  7zip and
similar multi-format graphical tools can handle these, or you can get
Windows ports of the command line gzip and tar tools from multiple
sources.  *Note Other useful ports::.

   The command to unpack a source distribution from the command line is:
     tar xzf emacs-24.4.tar.gz

   If this does not work with the versions of tar and gzip that you
have, you may need to try a two step process:
     gzip -dc emacs-24.4.tar.gz | tar xvf -

   You may see many messages from tar complaining about being unable to
change the modification time on directories, and from gzip complaining
about a broken pipe.  These messages are usually harmless, caused by
incomplete ports that are not fully aware of the limitations of Windows.

3.2 How do I install Emacs after unpacking?
===========================================

You can run Emacs without any extra steps, but if you want icons in your
Start Menu, or for Emacs to detect the image libraries that are already
installed on your system as part of GTK, then you should run the program
`emacs-24.4\bin\addpm.exe'.


File: efaq-w32.info,  Node: Image support,  Next: Init file,  Prev: Installing,  Up: Installing Emacs

3.3 How do I get image support?
===============================

Emacs has built in support for XBM and PBM/PGM/PPM images.  This is
sufficient to see the monochrome splash screen and tool-bar icons.
Since 22.2, the official precompiled binaries for Windows have bundled
libXpm, which is required to display the color versions of those images.

   Emacs is compiled to recognize JPEG, PNG, GIF and TIFF images also,
but displaying these image types require external DLLs which are not
bundled with Emacs.  *Note Other useful ports::.


File: efaq-w32.info,  Node: Init file,  Next: Location of init file,  Prev: Image support,  Up: Installing Emacs

3.4 What is my init file?
=========================

When Emacs starts up, it attempts to load and execute the contents of a
file commonly called `.emacs' (though it may have other names, *note
Where do I put my init file?: Installing Emacs.) which contains any
customizations you have made.  You can manually add lisp code to your
.emacs, or you can use the Customization interface accessible from the
_Options_ menu.  If the file does not exist, Emacs will start with the
default settings.


File: efaq-w32.info,  Node: Location of init file,  Next: Troubleshooting init file,  Prev: Init file,  Up: Installing Emacs

3.5 Where do I put my init file?
================================

On Windows, the .emacs file may be called _emacs for backward
compatibility with DOS and FAT filesystems where filenames could not
start with a dot.  Some users prefer to continue using such a name,
because Explorer cannot create a file with a name starting with a dot,
even though the filesystem and most other programs can handle it.  In
Emacs 22 and later, the init file may also be called
`.emacs.d/init.el'.  Many of the other files that are created by lisp
packages are now stored in the `.emacs.d' directory too, so this keeps
all your Emacs related files in one place.

   All the files mentioned above should go in your `HOME' directory.
The `HOME' directory is determined by following the steps below:

  1. If the environment variable `HOME' is set, use the directory it
     indicates.

  2. If the registry entry `HKCU\SOFTWARE\GNU\Emacs\HOME' is set, use
     the directory it indicates.

  3. If the registry entry `HKLM\SOFTWARE\GNU\Emacs\HOME' is set, use
     the directory it indicates.  Not recommended, as it results in
     users sharing the same HOME directory.

  4. If `C:\.emacs' exists, then use `C:/'.  This is for backward
     compatibility, as previous versions defaulted to `C:/' if `HOME'
     was not set.

  5. Use the user's AppData directory, usually a directory called
     `Application Data' under the user's profile directory, the location
     of which varies according to Windows version and whether the
     computer is part of a domain.

   Within Emacs, <~> at the beginning of a file name is expanded to your
`HOME' directory, so you can always find your .emacs file with `C-x C-f
~/.emacs'.


File: efaq-w32.info,  Node: Troubleshooting init file,  Next: Associate files with Emacs,  Prev: Location of init file,  Up: Installing Emacs

3.6 Troubleshooting init file problems
======================================

If you've set `HOME' to a directory using one of the above methods, and
Emacs still doesn't load your init file, the first thing you should do
is check to see what Emacs thinks `HOME' is set to.  You can do this by
evaluating the following expression in the `*scratch*' buffer using
`C-x C-e':

     (insert (getenv "HOME"))

   Look carefully at what is printed and make sure the value is valid.
For example, if the value has trailing whitespace, Emacs won't be able
to find the directory.  Also, be sure that the value isn't a relative
drive letter (e.g., `d:' without a backslash); if it is, then `HOME' is
going to be whatever the current directory on that drive is, which is
likely not what you want to happen.


File: efaq-w32.info,  Node: Associate files with Emacs,  Next: Find-file and the Desktop,  Prev: Troubleshooting init file,  Up: Installing Emacs

3.7 How do I associate files with Emacs?
========================================

The recommended way to associate files is to associate them with
`emacsclientw.exe'.  In order for this to work when Emacs is not yet
started, you will also need to set the environment variable
`ALTERNATE_EDITOR' to `runemacs.exe'.  To open files in a running
instance of Emacs, you will need to add the following to your init file:
     (server-start)

* Menu:

* Using with Explorer::


File: efaq-w32.info,  Node: Using with Explorer,  Up: Associate files with Emacs

3.7.1 For use with Internet Explorer
------------------------------------

You can use Emacs as the editor for composing mail for <mailto:> links,
reading usenet for <news:> links, and viewing source.  The following
registry entries control this:

     Mail
        * *Key:* HKCR\mailto\shell\open\command\(Default)

        * *Value:* emacsclientw -e "(message-mail (substring \"%1\" 7))"

     News
        * *Key:* HKCR\news\shell\open\command\(Default)

        * *Value:* emacsclientw -e "(gnus-fetch-group (substring \"%1\"
          5)"

     View Source
        * *Key:* HKCR\htmlfile\shell\edit\command\(Default)

        * *Value:* emacsclientw "%1"


   Thanks to Jason Rumney and Sigbjorn Finne for these tips.


File: efaq-w32.info,  Node: Find-file and the Desktop,  Next: Make Windows more like X,  Prev: Associate files with Emacs,  Up: Installing Emacs

3.8 How do I use find-file to open files that are on the Desktop?
=================================================================

The location of the Desktop varies between different versions of
Windows, and in a corporate environment can be moved around by the
network administrator.  On NT derivatives, you can use the value of the
`USERPROFILE' environment variable to find where the desktop might be:

     C-x C-f $USERPROFILE/Desktop

   If this doesn't work, then you probably have to forgo the keyboard
just this once, and either drag a file onto the Emacs frame from the
desktop, or use the file dialog (displayed when you use the toolbar or
menu by default).  Once you have a file from the Desktop inside Emacs,
`C-x C-f' will quickly reveal where your desktop is kept.

File: efaq-w32.info,  Node: Focus follows mouse,  Next: Swap CapsLock and Control,  Up: Make Windows more like X

3.9.1 How do it make the active window follow the mouse?
--------------------------------------------------------

Customize the variables `focus-follows-mouse' and
`mouse-autoselect-window'.  The former can be used to mislead Emacs
into giving focus to other frames when the mouse is over them, even
though Windows has a click to focus policy by default (there is
software available to change that though).  The latter can be used to
make Emacs use a focus-follow-mouse policy within its own frames.


File: efaq-w32.info,  Node: Swap CapsLock and Control,  Prev: Focus follows mouse,  Up: Make Windows more like X

3.9.2 How do I swap CapsLock and Control?
-----------------------------------------

This cannot be done within Emacs, but you can modify the scan code
mappings in the registry or define a new keyboard layout to swap the
keys on a system wide basis.

* Menu:

* Swap Caps NT::
* Swap Caps 98::


File: efaq-w32.info,  Node: Swap Caps NT,  Next: Swap Caps 98,  Up: Swap CapsLock and Control

3.9.2.1 Windows NT/2000/XP/Vista?
.................................

   * From Chris McMahon.  To make CapsLock a Control key (leaving your
     original control keys as they were), use this registry file:
          REGEDIT4

          [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layout]
          "Scancode Map"=hex:00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,02,00,00,00,1d,00,3a,00,00,00,00,00
     To swap CapsLock and the left Control key, use:
          REGEDIT4

          [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layout]
          "Scancode Map"=hex:00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,03,00,00,00,1d,00,3a,00,3a,00,1d,00,00,00,00,00
     Save these as files with a `.reg' extension, and double-click on
     them in Explorer, or "run" them from a command prompt to have them
     update your registry (you may need to reboot).

   * Shane Holder gives some background on how "Scancode Map" is used
     by the system:
          It's a binary value that lets you map keystrokes in the low-level keyboard
          drivers in NT.  As a result you don't have to worry about applications
          bypassing mappings that you've done at a higher level (i.e. it just works).

          Here's the format of the value:

          	DWORD:	0x00000000	header
          	DWORD:	0x00000000	header
          	DWORD:	length (in DWORDs) of remaining data, including terminating DWORD
          	DWORD:	mapping 1
          	...
          	DWORD:	mapping n
          	DWORD:	0x00000000	terminating null DWORD

          Each mapping DWORD  has two parts: the input scancode, and an output
          scancode.  To map scancode 0x1d (left control) to scancode 0x3a (caps
          lock), you want a value of 0x003a001d.  Note that this does not swap the
          keys.  Using just this mapping value, both the left control and the caps
          lock key will behave as caps-lock.  To swap, you also need to map 0x3a to
          0x1d, using 0x001d003a.

          This registry value is system wide, and can't be made user-specific.  It
          also only takes affect on reboot.

   * Ulfar Erlingsson has provided a registry file that sets the
     CapsLock key to be a Control key and the Windows key to be an Alt
     key:
          REGEDIT4

          [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layout]
          "Scancode Map"=hex:00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,03,00,00,00,1d,00,3a,00,38,00,5b,e0,00,00,00,00

3.10 How can I modify Emacs to act more like a Windows app?
===========================================================

Many beginning users find Emacs difficult to use because its user
interface is different in many ways.  Emacs predates most UI standards,
and experienced Emacs users are used to the way things are, so changing
the defaults is difficult.  Most of the "standard" behavior can be
approximated in Emacs after some configuring though.

* Menu:

* Highlight selection::
* CUA::


File: efaq-w32.info,  Node: Highlight selection,  Next: CUA,  Up: Make Emacs like a Windows app

3.10.1 Highlighting the selection
---------------------------------

Emacs has a concept of a mark and point that is similar to selections
in other programs.  But the mark in Emacs is used for more than just
defining the selected region, it lives on while you continue to edit
and move around the buffer so it can also be a kind of bookmark.  The
history of marks is saved so you can pop previous marks back to the top
of the stack to go back to somewhere you were some time ago.  Because
of this dual purpose, the region between mark and point is not
highlighted by default unless you select a region by clicking and
dragging the mouse.

   The minor mode `transient-mark-mode' changes the behavior of the
mark in two ways.  First, it distinguishes between an active mark that
has just been defined or reactivated, and an inactive mark.  When the
mark is active, some commands that normally act on lines, words,
buffers etc. will instead act on the region.  An inactive mark needs to
be reactivated to operate on it, unless `mark-even-if-inactive' is set.
Secondly, `transient-mark-mode' also highlights the region when it is
active, providing the same visual clue that you get in other programs.

   In addition to seeing the highlighting, new Emacs users often expect
editing commands to replace the region when it is active.  This behavior
can be obtained with `delete-selection-mode', but see the following
question also.


File: efaq-w32.info,  Node: CUA,  Prev: Highlight selection,  Up: Make Emacs like a Windows app

3.10.2 Standard Windows key bindings
------------------------------------

The keybindings of Emacs predate modern GUIs, and the keys that were
chosen by later GUIs for cut and copy were given important functions as
extended keymaps in Emacs.  CUA mode attempts to let both bindings
co-exist by defining C-x and C-c as `kill-region' and
`copy-region-as-kill' when the region is active, and letting them have
their normal Emacs bindings when the region is not active.  Many people
find this to be an acceptable compromise.  CUA mode also defines a
number of other keys (C-v, Shift selection), and can be turned on from
the _Options_ menu.

3.11 Window operations
======================

The function `w32-send-sys-command' can be used to simulate choosing
commands from the system menu (in the top left corner of the Window)
and a few other system wide functions.  It takes an integer argument,
the value of which should be a valid `WM_SYSCOMMAND' message as
documented in Microsoft's API documentation.


File: efaq-w32.info,  Node: Uninstall,  Next: Does not run,  Prev: Window operations,  Up: Installing Emacs

3.12 How do I uninstall Emacs?
==============================

Emacs does not come with an uninstall program.  No files are installed
outside of the Emacs base directory, so deleting that directory is
sufficient to clean away the files.  If you ran `addpm', you'll need to
delete the Start Menu group too.  The registry entries inserted by
`addpm' will not cause any problems if you leave them there, but for
the sake of completeness, you can use `regedit' to remove the keys
under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE' orx `HKEY_CURRENT_USER':
`SOFTWARE\GNU\Emacs', and the key
`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App
Paths\emacs.exe' if it exists.


File: efaq-w32.info,  Node: Does not run,  Next: Virus,  Prev: Uninstall,  Up: Installing Emacs

3.13 When I run Emacs nothing happens
=====================================

Emacs could have failed to run for a number of reasons.  The most
common symptom is that, when Emacs is started, the cursor changes for a
second but nothing happens.  If this happens to you, it is quite likely
that the distribution was unpacked incorrectly.

   Check for the following to see if there was a problem during
unpacking:
  1. Be sure to disable the CR/LF translation or the executables will be
     unusable.  Older versions of WinZipNT would enable this
     translation by default.  If you are using WinZipNT, disable it.

  2. Check that filenames were not truncated to 8.3.  For example, there
     should be a file CONTRIBUTE in the top level directory; if this has
     been truncated to CONTRIBU or CONTRI~1, your distribution has been

3.14 Does Emacs contain a virus?
================================

There have been reports in the past that some virus scanners claim that
the Emacs distribution has a virus.  This is extremely unlikely if you
have downloaded Emacs from the GNU FTP site or one of its mirrors and
the GPG signature for it is valid and listed in the GNU keyring, unless
perhaps it is a new release made in the last few days, in which case
you should exercise more caution and report the problem.  Past problems
seem to have been caused by virus checkers running into a buffer size
limit when unpacking large tar.gz files for scanning, and reporting the
failure as an "unknown virus".


File: efaq-w32.info,  Node: Anti-virus,  Prev: Virus,  Up: Installing Emacs

3.15 What known problems are there with anti-virus software?
============================================================

Anti-virus and firewall software can block Emacs from starting
subprocesses and opening network connections.  Most such products have
an Advanced mode where they will prompt you rather than silently
blocking.  In some cases the "scan all files" or "auto protect" option
of anti-virus programs has caused failures running shell related
commands within Emacs.  *Note Why is nothing happening when I enter
shell commands?: Sub-processes.

4.1 Emacs in console mode goes beyond the window size
=====================================================

The variable `w32-use-full-screen-buffer' controls whether Emacs uses
the window size or buffer size to determine the number of lines on
screen.  Normally the window size is correct, but when running Emacs
over some telnet servers, the buffer size needs to be used.  Emacs
tries to guess the correct value at startup, but if it guesses wrong,
you can customize that variable yourself.

4.2 What do I do if I have problems with my mouse buttons?
==========================================================

Emacs assigns bindings assuming a three button mouse.  On Windows, if a
two button mouse is detected, a hack is enabled which lets you simulate
the third button by pressing both mouse buttons simultaneously.
`w32-mouse-button-tolerance' defines the timeout for what is considered
"simultaneous".  You can check how many buttons Emacs thinks your mouse
has with `C-h v' `w32-num-mouse-buttons'.

   If you find yourself needing the mouse-3 bindings more often than
mouse-2, you can swap the buttons with the following code in your init
file:
     (setq w32-swap-mouse-buttons t)


File: efaq-w32.info,  Node: Cut and paste NUL,  Next: Garbled clipboard,  Prev: Mouse trouble,  Up: Display Settings

4.3 How do I cut and paste text with NUL characters?
====================================================

If you attempt to cut and paste text with NUL characters embedded in it,
then the text will be truncated at the first NUL character.  This is a
limitation of the Windows clipboard, and does not affect killing and
yanking from the kill-ring within Emacs.

You can try `set-selection-coding-system', but generally such

5.1 Font names
==============

Fonts in Emacs 22 and earlier are named using the X Logical Font
Description (XLFD) format.  Emacs on Windows ignores many of the
fields, and populates them with * when listing fonts.  Former
maintainer Andrew Innes wrote this explanation
(http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/ntemacs/discuss/x-font-details)
of what each field in the font string means and how Emacs treated them
back in 19.34.  Since then, multilingual support and a redisplay
overhaul to support variable width fonts have changed things slightly;
more character sets are recognized (and the old pseudo character sets
are deprecated), and the resolution fields are used to calculate the
difference between point and pixel sizes, but normally you should leave
these at the system default.  The foundry field is also populated with
an indication of whether the font is outline (.TTF, .ATM) or raster
(.FON) based when fonts are listed, which may let you differentiate
between two fonts with the same name and different technologies.

   From Emacs 23, the preferred font name format will be moving to the
simpler and more flexible fontconfig format.  XLFD names will continue
to be supported for backward compatibility.

     XLFD: -*-Courier New-normal-r-*-*-13-*-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1
     Fontconfig: Courier New-13

   To find the XFLD name for a font, you can execute the following in
the `*scratch*' buffer by pressing C-j at the end of the line:
     (w32-select-font nil t)

   To see a complete list of fonts, execute the following in the
`*scratch*' buffer by pressing C-x C-e at the end of the line:
     (insert (prin1-to-string (x-list-fonts "*")))

   The command line options and frame-parameters for changing the
default font in Emacs are documented in the manual.  Fonts can also be
used when defining faces, though family and size are generally
specified individually there.  In addition, Emacs on Windows reads the
registry to find X Resources.  This is also documented in the manual.

5.2 How can I get bold and italic fonts to work?
================================================

Emacs will only use the italic (and bold) versions of a font
automatically if it has the same width as the normal version.  Many
fonts have italic and bold versions that are slightly wider.  It will
also only use real bold and italic fonts by default, where other
applications may use synthesized variations that are derived from the
normal font.  To enable more italic and bold fonts to be displayed, you
can enable synthesized fonts and manually set the font for italic, bold
and bold-italic as follows:

     (setq w32-enable-synthesized-fonts t)
     (set-face-font 'italic "-*-Courier New-normal-i-*-*-11-*-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1")
     (set-face-font 'bold-italic "-*-Courier New-bold-i-*-*-11-*-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1")

5.3.1 Is it possible to display all the supported languages?
------------------------------------------------------------

To display all the languages that Emacs is capable of displaying, you
will require the BDF fonts from the GNU intlfonts package.  *Note How
do I use bdf fonts with Emacs?: Fonts and text translation.

   For many languages, native truetype fonts are sufficient, and in
Emacs 23 the need for BDF fonts will disappear for almost all
languages.  At the time of writing, some Arabic characters in the HELLO
file still do not display with native fonts, because they are
pre-composed characters from MULE character sets rather than standard
Unicode Arabic, but all other characters are able to be displayed with
appropriate truetype or opentype fonts.

5.3.2 How do I get Emacs to display non-latin characters?
---------------------------------------------------------

Recent versions of Emacs display a large range of characters out of the
box, but if you are having problems with a particular character set
which you know you have fonts for, you can try defining a new fontset
with `create-fontset-from-ascii-font' or
`create-fontset-from-fontset-spec'.

     (create-fontset-from-fontset-spec
      "-*-Courier New-normal-r-*-*-12-*-*-*-c-*-fontset-most,

5.3.3 Where can I find fonts for other languages?
-------------------------------------------------

In addition to the wide range of fonts that come with the language
support packages of various components of Windows itself, GNU/Linux
distributions these days come with a number of Free truetype fonts that
cover a wide range of languages.  The GNU intlfonts source distribution
contains BDF fonts covering all of the languages that can be displayed
by Emacs 22, and can be downloaded from ftp.gnu.org mirrors
(http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/intlfonts).

5.3.4 How do I use third party programs to display multibyte characters?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

You probably only need to do this on the non-Unicode versions of Windows
(95, 98 and ME), and even then, various Windows and Internet Explorer
updates have made third party software unnecessary in most cases.  If
you are having trouble displaying text, try defining a fontset with the
font for the languages that the third party software handles set to
what that software expects (which may not be an appropriate font for
that language, but the third party software is intercepting it and
using a different font behind the scenes).  *Note Non-latin display::.

   In addition to defining a fontset with the expected font, you may
also need to disable unicode output with:
     (setq w32-enable-unicode-output nil)

5.3.5 Can I use a font with a name in my language?
--------------------------------------------------

Normally Emacs should initialize `locale-coding-system' appropriately
based on your locale, which will let Emacs use font names in your local
language successfully.


File: efaq-w32.info,  Node: BDF fonts,  Next: Font menu,  Prev: Multilingual fonts,  Up: Fonts and text translation

5.4 How do I use bdf fonts with Emacs?
======================================

To use bdf fonts with Emacs, you need to tell Emacs where the fonts are
located, create fontsets for them, and then use them.  We'll use the 16
dot international fonts from ftp.gnu.org/gnu/intlfonts
(http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/intlfonts) as an example put together by
Jason Rumney.

   Download `16dots.tar.gz' and unpack it; I'll assume that they are in
`c:\intlfonts'.  Then set `w32-bdf-filename-alist' to the list of fonts
returned by using `w32-find-bdf-fonts' to enumerate all of the font
files.  It is a good idea to set the variable `bdf-directory-list' at
the same time so `ps-print' knows where to find the fonts:
     (setq bdf-directory-list
           '("c:/intlfonts/Asian" "c:/intlfonts/Chinese"
             "c:/intlfonts/Chinese-X" "c:/intlfonts/Ethiopic"
     	"c:/intlfonts/European" "c:/intlfonts/Japanese"
             "c:/intlfonts/Japanese-X" "c:/intlfonts/Korean-X"
     	"c:/intlfonts/Misc/"))

     (setq w32-bdf-filename-alist (w32-find-bdf-fonts bdf-directory-list))

   Then create fontsets for the BDF fonts:

     (create-fontset-from-fontset-spec
      "-*-fixed-medium-r-normal-*-16-*-*-*-c-*-fontset-bdf,
     japanese-jisx0208:-*-*-medium-r-normal-*-16-*-*-*-c-*-jisx0208.1983-*,
     katakana-jisx0201:-*-*-medium-r-normal-*-16-*-*-*-c-*-jisx0201*-*,
     latin-jisx0201:-*-*-medium-r-normal-*-16-*-*-*-c-*-jisx0201*-*,
     japanese-jisx0208-1978:-*-*-medium-r-normal-*-16-*-*-*-c-*-jisx0208.1978-*,
     thai-tis620:-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--16-160-72-72-m-80-tis620.2529-1,
     lao:-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--16-160-72-72-m-80-MuleLao-1,
     tibetan-1-column:-TibMdXA-fixed-medium-r-normal--16-160-72-72-m-80-MuleTibetan-1,
     ethiopic:-Admas-Ethiomx16f-Medium-R-Normal--16-150-100-100-M-160-Ethiopic-Unicode,
     tibetan:-TibMdXA-fixed-medium-r-normal--16-160-72-72-m-160-MuleTibetan-0")

   Many of the international bdf fonts from gnu.org are type 0, and
therefore need to be added to font-encoding-alist:

     ;; Need to add some fonts to font-encoding-alist since the bdf fonts
     ;; are type 0 not the default type 1.
     (setq font-encoding-alist
           (append '(("MuleTibetan-0" (tibetan . 0))
                     ("GB2312"        (chinese-gb2312 . 0))
                     ("JISX0208"      (japanese-jisx0208 . 0))
                     ("JISX0212"      (japanese-jisx0212 . 0))
                     ("VISCII"        (vietnamese-viscii-lower . 0))
                     ("KSC5601"       (korean-ksc5601 . 0))
                     ("MuleArabic-0"  (arabic-digit . 0))
                     ("MuleArabic-1"  (arabic-1-column . 0))
                     ("MuleArabic-2"  (arabic-2-column . 0))) font-encoding-alist))

   You can now use the Emacs font menu (*note How can I have Emacs use
a font menu like on X?: Fonts and text translation.) to select the
_bdf: 16-dot medium_ fontset, or you can select it by setting the
default font:

         (set-frame-font "fontset-bdf")

   Try loading the file `etc/HELLO', and you should be able to see the
various international fonts displayed (except for Hindi, which is not
included in the 16-dot font distribution).

If you have set w32-use-w32-font-dialog to `nil', you can add fonts to
the font menu by changing `w32-fixed-font-alist'.  For example:

     (setq w32-fixed-font-alist
        (append w32-fixed-font-alist
           '(("Monotype.com"
              ("8" "-*-Monotype.com-normal-r-*-*-11-*-*-*-c-iso8859-1")
              ("9" "-*-Monotype.com-normal-r-*-*-12-*-*-*-c-iso8859-1")
              ("10" "-*-Monotype.com-normal-r-*-*-13-*-*-*-c-iso8859-1")
              ("11" "-*-Monotype.com-normal-r-*-*-15-*-*-*-c-iso8859-1")))))

5.6 How can I control CR/LF translation?
========================================

There are a number of methods by which you can control automatic CR/LF
translation in Emacs, a situation that reflects the fact that the
default support was not very robust in the past.  For a discussion of
this issue, take a look at this collection of email messages
(http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/ntemacs/todo/translate) on
the topic.

File: efaq-w32.info,  Node: Automatic line ends,  Next: Line ends by filename,  Up: Line ends

5.6.1 Automatic CR/LF translation
---------------------------------

For existing files, Emacs scans the file to determine the line ending
convention as part of the same scan it does to determine the file
encoding.  Embedded Ctrl-M (ASCII 13) characters and inconsistent line
ends can confuse the automatic scanning, and Emacs will present the
file in Unix (LF) mode with the Ctrl-M characters displayed as `^M'.
It does this to be safe, as no data loss will occur if the file is
really binary and the Ctrl-M characters are significant.


File: efaq-w32.info,  Node: Line ends by filename,  Next: Line ends by file system,  Prev: Automatic line ends,  Up: Line ends

5.6.2 CR/LF translation by file extension
-----------------------------------------

The variable `file-name-buffer-file-type-alist' holds a list of
filename patterns and their associated type; binary or text.  Files
marked as binary will not have line-end detection performed on them,
and instead will always be displayed as is.  With auto-detection in
recent versions of Emacs, this is seldom useful for existing files, but
can still be used to influence the choice of line ends for newly
created files.


File: efaq-w32.info,  Node: Line ends by file system,  Prev: Line ends by filename,  Up: Line ends

5.6.3 CR/LF translation by file system
--------------------------------------

The variable `untranslated-filesystem-list' defines whole directory
trees that should not have CR/LF autodetection performed on them.  The
list can be manipulated with the functions
`add-untranslated-filesystem' and `remove-untranslated-filesystem'.
With auto-detection in recent versions of Emacs, this is seldom useful
for existing files, but can still be used to influence the choice of
line ends for newly created files.

6 Printing
**********

A lot of effort has gone into making it easier to print from Emacs on
MS Windows, but this has still been insufficient to keep up with
changes in printing technology from text and postscript based printers
connected via ports that can be accessed directly, to graphical
printers that are only accessible via USB.  For details, see Emacs Wiki

7.1 Quoting issues
==================

The quoting rules for native Windows shells and Cygwin shells have some
subtle differences.  When Emacs spawns subprocesses, it tries to
determine whether the process is a Cygwin program and changes its
quoting mechanism appropriately.  See this previous discussion
(http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/ntemacs/discuss/shell-quoting)
for details.

7.2 Programs reading input hang
===============================

Programs that explicitly use a handle to the console (`CON' or `CON:')
instead of stdin and stdout cannot be used as subprocesses to Emacs,
and they will also not work in shell-mode.  The default ftp client on
Windows is an example of such a program - this ftp program is mostly
fine for use with `ange-ftp' or `tramp', but not for `M-x ftp' (*note
How do I use FTP within Emacs: Network access.).  There is no
convenient way for either Emacs or any shell used in `shell-mode' to
redirect the input and output of such processes from the console to
input and output pipes.  The only workaround is to use a different
implementation of the program that does not use the console directly.
Microsoft's new PowerShell appears to be another such program, so that
cannot be used as a replacement shell for Emacs.


File: efaq-w32.info,  Node: Subprocess buffering,  Next: Subprocesses and floppy drive,  Prev: Subprocess hang,  Up: Sub-processes

7.3 Buffering in shells and subprocesses
========================================

You may notice that some programs, when run in a shell in `shell-mode',
have their output buffered (e.g., people have found this happening to
them with `sql-mode').  When the program has a lot of output, it
overflows the buffering and gets printed to the shell buffer; however,
if the program only outputs a small amount of text, it will remain
buffered and won't appear in the shell buffer.  The same can happen in
other subprocesses that themselves run other programs as subprocesses,
for example when using `cvs' from Emacs, which is itself configured to
use `ssh', password prompts fail to appear when expected, and `cvs'
appears to hang.

   Although it may at first seem like the shell is buffering the output
from the program, it is actually the program that is buffering output.
The C runtime typically decides how to buffer output based upon whether
stdout is bound to a handle to a console window or not.  If bound to a
console window, output is buffered line by line; if bound to a block
device, such as a file, output is buffered block by block.

   In a shell buffer, stdout is a pipe handle and so is buffered in
blocks.  If you would like the buffering behavior of your program to
behave differently, the program itself is going to have to be changed;
you can use `setbuf' and `setvbuf' to manipulate the buffering
semantics.

   Some programs handle this by having an explicit flag to control their
buffering behavior, typically `-i' for interactive.  Other programs
manage to detect that they are running under Emacs, by using
`getenv("emacs")' internally.

7.3.1 Perl script buffering
---------------------------

A handy solution for Perl scripts to the above problem is to use:

     # Turn all buffering off.
     select((select(STDOUT), $| = 1)[0]);
     select((select(STDERR), $| = 1)[0]);
     select((select(STDIN), $| = 1)[0]);

7.4 16-bit subprocesses accessing the floppy drive
==================================================

If you are finding the 16 bit DOS subprocesses cause your A: drive to
be accessed, hanging Emacs until the read times out if there is no
floppy in the drive, check to see if your virus software is causing the
problem.

7.5 Killing subprocesses on Windows 95/98/Me
============================================

Emacs cannot guarantee that a subprocess gets killed on Windows 95 and
its descendants, and it is a difficult limitation to work around.  To
avoid problems on these systems, you should let subprocesses run to
completion including explicitly exiting shells before killing the
associated buffer.

   If you find that while shutting down, Windows complains that there is

7.6 Sending EOF to subprocesses
===============================

When an EOF is sent to a subprocess running in an interactive shell
with `process-send-eof', the shell terminates unexpectedly as if its
input was closed.  This affects the use of `C-c C-d' in shell buffers.
See this discussion
(http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/ntemacs/todo/shell-ctrl-d)

7.7 How do I use a shell in Emacs?
==================================

You can start an interactive shell in Emacs by typing `M-x shell'.
Emacs uses the `SHELL' environment variable to determine which program
to use as the shell.  To instruct Emacs to use a non-default shell, you
can either set this environment variable, or customize
`explicit-shell-file-name'.  You can also customize `shell-file-name'
to change the shell that will be used by subprocesses that are started
with `shell-command' and related non-interactive shell commands.

File: efaq-w32.info,  Node: Bash,  Up: Using shell

7.7.1 bash
----------

Cygwin bash is a popular shell for use with Emacs.  To use bash as the
default shell in Emacs, you can place the following in your init file:

     (defun my-shell-setup ()
       "For Cygwin bash under Emacs 20"
       (setq comint-scroll-show-maximum-output 'this)
       (make-variable-buffer-local 'comint-completion-addsuffix))
       (setq comint-completion-addsuffix t)
       ;; (setq comint-process-echoes t) ;; reported that this is no longer needed
       (setq comint-eol-on-send t)
       (setq w32-quote-process-args ?\")

     (add-hook 'shell-mode-hook 'my-shell-setup)

   If you find that you are having trouble with Emacs tracking drive
changes with bash, see Mike Fabian's note
(http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/ntemacs/discuss/drive-tracking).

   WARNING: Some versions of bash set and use the environment variable
PID.  For some as yet unknown reason, if `PID' is set and Emacs passes
it on to bash subshells, bash dies (Emacs can inherit the `PID'
variable if it's started from a bash shell).  If you clear the `PID'
variable in your init file, you should be able to continue to use bash
as your subshell:
         (setenv "PID" nil)

7.9 How do I make dired use my ls program?
==========================================

Dired uses an internal lisp implementation of `ls' by default on
Windows.  For consistent display of symbolic links and other
information with other programs (eg Cygwin) and performance reasons,
you may want to use a Windows port of `ls' instead.

     (setq ls-lisp-use-insert-directory-program t)      ;; use external ls
     (setq insert-directory-program "c:/cygwin/bin/ls") ;; ls program name

7.10 How do I prevent shell commands from being echoed?
=======================================================

Some shells echo the commands that you send to them, and the echoed
commands appear in the output buffer.  In particular, the default
shells, `command.com' and `cmd.exe', have this behavior.

   To prevent echoed commands from being printed, you can place the
following in your init file:

         (defun my-comint-init ()
           (setq comint-process-echoes t))
         (add-hook 'comint-mode-hook 'my-comint-init)

   If `shell-mode' still is not stripping echoed commands, then you'll
have to explicitly tell the shell to not echo commands.  You can do
this by setting the `explicit-SHELL-args' variable appropriately; where
SHELL is the value of your `SHELL' environment variable (do a `M-:
(getenv "SHELL")' to see what it is currently set to).  Assuming that
you are on NT and that your `SHELL' environment variable is set to
`cmd.exe', then placing the following in your init file will tell
`cmd.exe' to not echo commands:

         (setq explicit-cmd.exe-args '("/q"))

   The comint package will use the value of this variable as an argument
to `cmd.exe' every time it starts up a new shell; the `/q' is the
argument to `cmd.exe' that stops the echoing (invoking `cmd /?' in a
shell will show you all of the command line arguments to `cmd.exe').

   Note that this variable is case sensitive; if the value of your
`SHELL' environment variable is `CMD.EXE' instead, then this variable
needs to be named `explicit-CMD.EXE-args' instead.

7.11 How can I make shell completion use forward slashes?
=========================================================

The character appended to directory names when completing in a shell
buffer is controlled by the variable `comint-completion-addsuffix'.
See its documentation (with `C-h v') for details.


File: efaq-w32.info,  Node: Incorrect DOS version,  Next: Shell commands do nothing,  Prev: Shell completion forward slash,  Up: Sub-processes

7.12 Why do I get incorrect DOS version messages?
=================================================

This might happen if, for example, you invoke `nmake' in a shell and it
tries to create sub-shells.  The problem happens because when the shell
is initially created, the first argument to the shell is not the
directory in which the shell program resides.  When this happens,
`command.com' fabricates a value for its `COMSPEC' environment variable
that is incorrect.  Then, when other programs go to use `COMSPEC' to
find the shell, they are given the wrong value.

   The fix for this is to either prevent any arguments from being sent
to the shell when it starts up (in which case `command.com' will use a
default, and correct, value for `COMSPEC'), or to have the first
argument be the directory in which the shell executable resides.

8.1 How do I use mail in Emacs?
===============================

Emacs comes with several options for reading and writing mail.  These
are documented in the manual, and the choice of which method to use
depends on personal taste.  There are some issues specific to Windows
however, related to the fact that Windows machines do not have the mail
infrastructure that is commonly installed on other platforms, so mail
will not work without some configuration.

File: efaq-w32.info,  Node: Outgoing mail,  Next: Incoming mail with Rmail,  Up: Mail

8.1.1 Outgoing mail
-------------------

For outgoing mail, you will need to use `smtpmail.el' which allows
Emacs to talk directly to SMTP mail servers.  This is included with
Emacs, and can be set up as follows:

     (setq user-full-name "YOUR FULL NAME")
     (setq user-mail-address "YOUR@EMAIL.ADDRESS")
     (setq smtpmail-default-smtp-server "DOMAIN.NAME.OF.YOUR.SMTP.SERVER")

     (setq send-mail-command 'smtpmail-send-it) ; For mail-mode (Rmail)
     (setq message-send-mail-function 'smtpmail-send-it) ; For message-mode (Gnus)

   Note that if you want to change the name of the SMTP server after
smtpmail is loaded, then you'll need to change `smtpmail-smtp-server'.

   If you are experiencing problems with sending large messages, check
the value of the variable `smtpmail-debug-info'. If it is non-`nil',
you should set it to `nil':

8.1.2 Incoming mail with Rmail and POP3
---------------------------------------

For incoming mail using the Rmail package and a POP3 server, you will
need the following configuration:

     (setenv "MAILHOST" "DOMAIN.NAME.OF.YOUR.POP3.SERVER")
     (setq rmail-primary-inbox-list '("po:YOUR LOGON ID"))
     (setq rmail-pop-password-required t)

8.1.3 Incoming mail with Gnus
-----------------------------

Although Gnus started life as a Usenet news reader, it also makes a
good mail reader, particularly if you subscribe to a lot of mailing
lists, or you want to use IMAP rather than POP3, which is not supported
by Rmail.  *Note The Gnus manual: (gnus)Top.

8.1.4 Other incoming mail options
---------------------------------

Other options for reading mail in Emacs include VM, MH-E and Wanderlust.
MH-E is included with Emacs.  The others require lisp or executable code
that does not come with Emacs, so you should seek help where you
obtained the packages from if you want to use them.


File: efaq-w32.info,  Node: Attachments with Gnus,  Next: Using FTP,  Prev: Mail,  Up: Network access

8.2 How do I open attachments in Gnus?
======================================

In your `HOME' directory create a file called `.mailcap', with contents
like the following:
     application/zip "C:/Program Files/7-Zip/7zFM.exe"
     video/* "C:/Program Files/VideoLAN/VLC/vlc.exe"

   *Warning:* Associating MIME types with `start' or other generic
Windows commands to open arbitrary files might seem like a good idea,
but it leaves your system as open to attack as Outlook Express was at
its worst.  Especially dangerous is associating application/* or */* in
this way.

8.3 How do I use FTP within Emacs?
==================================

Windows built in FTP client can be used with ange-ftp.  Ange-ftp is the
Emacs package that provides FTP connectivity to tramp, a multi-protocol
remote file access package for Emacs that is enabled by default.

   The Windows FTP client does have problems with some firewalls, due to
lack of passive mode support, so you may want to try an alternative ftp
client instead.  Make sure that the client you are trying is in your
`PATH' before the default Windows client, or rename the default Windows
client to avoid it getting in the way.  Alternatively you can customize
`ange-ftp-ftp-program-name' to the full path to the version you are
trying.  *Note Other useful ports::.


File: efaq-w32.info,  Node: Tramp ssh,  Next: telnet,  Prev: Using FTP,  Up: Network access

8.4 How do I use Tramp to work in Emacs via SSH?
================================================

Tramp can use a number of protocols to connect to remote machines to
read files and even run commands on those files remotely.  A popular
one is ssh.  As well as Cygwin versions of openssh, you can use PuTTY's
command line plink program as the ssh client.  The relevant methods to
use in `tramp-default-method' or `tramp-default-method-alist' for these
options are:
     openssh
        * `scp' Uses scp for copying, ssh for shell operations.

        * `ssh' Uses ssh with encoding on stdin/stdout for file
          transfer.

     PuTTY
        * `pscp' Uses pscp for copying, plink for shell operations.

        * `plink' Uses plink with encoding on stdin/stdout for file
          transfer.


File: efaq-w32.info,  Node: telnet,  Prev: Tramp ssh,  Up: Network access

8.5 How do I use telnet with Emacs?
===================================

To use telnet-mode on Windows, you need a telnet client that uses stdin
and stdout for input and output.  The default Windows client is a
Windows application, and will not work as a subprocess.  Several
options exist, but information that was formerly in this FAQ is out of
date now, so no concrete pointers are available.

------------

AUCTeX is an Emacs package for writing LaTeX files, which also includes

9.2 How do I perform spell checks?
==================================

Emacs has support for spell checking on demand (`ispell') and as your
type (`flyspell').  Both packages depend on a copy of `ispell' 3.2 or a
compatible spell-checking program.  GNU Aspell is a popular choice
these days, Windows installers are available from the official site
(http://aspell.net/win32/).

   Once installed, you will need to configure `ispell-program-name' to
tell ispell and flyspell to use `aspell' as a replacement for ispell.
You can include the full path to the `aspell' binary, which means you
do not need to add its installation directory to the `PATH'.

9.4 Why doesn't my wheel mouse work in Emacs?

Some wheel mice ship with default settings that do not send the
standard wheel events to programs, but instead try to simulate scroll
bar events.  Usually this is configurable from the hardware specific
pages on the mouse control panel.  The middle button is often mapped in
the same settings to have some functionality other than sending middle
mouse button events.  In some cases, uninstalling the manufacturer's
drivers and telling Windows to use the generic USB or PS/2 drivers is
the only way to make the mouse work properly.

9.5 How do I use grep with Emacs?
=================================

The best way to use `M-x grep' with Emacs is to download a port of GNU
`grep'. *Note Other useful ports::.

   If you want a quick solution without installing extra tools, a poor
substitute that works for simple text searches is to specify the built
in Windows command `findstr' as the command to run at the `M-x grep'
prompt.  Normally you will want to use the `/n' argument to `findstr'.

* Menu:

* Recursive grep::


File: efaq-w32.info,  Node: Recursive grep,  Up: Grep

9.5.1 How do I do a recursive grep?
-----------------------------------

The Emacs commands `rgrep', `grep-find' and `find-grep-dired' are all
different interfaces for grepping recursively into subdirectories.  By
default, they use the command `find' to determine which files to work
on, and either run `grep' directly from find, or use `xargs' to batch
up files and reduce the number of invocations of `grep'.

   Windows also comes with a `find' command, but it is not in any way
compatible with the POSIX `find' that Emacs tries to use.  Emacs
expects a `find' compatible with GNU findutils.  *Note Other useful
ports::.  After you have installed it, you will need to make sure that
Emacs finds this version, not the standard Windows `find' command.  You
can do this by either renaming the Windows command, changing your
`PATH' to ensure that the directory containing the findutils `bin'
directory comes before the Windows system directory, or set the
variable `find-program' to the full path to the findutils `find'
command.

   An alternative if you have a recent version of grep is to customize
`grep-find-command' to use `grep -r' instead of both find and grep.
Another alternative if you don't need the full capabilities of grep is
to use `findstr /n /r'.

10.1 How do I use Emacs with Microsoft Visual C++
=================================================

There are two ways you can use Emacs in conjunction with MSVC.  You can
use Emacs as the editor, and do everything else in the DevStudio IDE.
Or you can use Emacs as an IDE, calling the MSVC command line tools to
build your project.

10.1.2 Using MSVC command line tools from Emacs
-----------------------------------------------

This is an app note on how to use Microsoft Visual C++ with Emacs. The
experiments done below were done with Emacs 19.34.1 on Windows 95,
using Visual C++ 4.0 Standard Edition. Your mileage may vary.

   This writeup assumes minimal knowledge of Emacs hacking on the part
of the reader.

* Default compile command::

* Edit MSVC::


File: efaq-w32.info,  Node: VC++ environment,  Next: Default compile command,  Up: MSVC command line

10.1.2.1 VC++ Environment Variables
...................................

There is a batch file in your VC++ installation's bin directory called
`vcvars32.bat', which sets up the environment variables needed to run
the VC++ command line tools.  Arrange for those same environment
variables to be set in your Emacs session.  You can do this on Windows
9x by calling the `vcvars32.bat' script from `autoexec.bat'.  On other
versions of Windows you can set the environment variables globally
using the System control panel.

   For all versions of Windows you can alternatively set the variables
just inside Emacs by using `setenv' calls in your init file.  *Note
Where do I put my init file?: Installing Emacs.

   You should now be able to compile from Emacs. Load a source file from
a VC++ project. Type `M-x compile'. Replace the proposed command line
with:
     nmake -f PROJECTNAME.mak

   You will find that this defaults to a debug build. You can change it
to a release build with:
     nmake -f PROJECTNAME.mak CFG="PROJECTNAME - Win32 Release"


File: efaq-w32.info,  Node: Default compile command,  Next: Reverting buffers,  Prev: VC++ environment,  Up: MSVC command line

10.1.2.2 Setting the default compile command
............................................

Now set the default value for the compile command line.  Add the
following to your init file:

     ;; Set up for Visual C++ compiling
     (setq compile-command "nmake -f ")

   If you work on the same project long term, you can add the project
makefile to the string.

   David Biesack suggests that perhaps it's easy to write a `Makefile'
in the project directory which does

     PROJECT=MyProject
     all: debug
     debug: FORCE
             nmake /f $(PROJECT).mak CFG="$(PROJECT) - Win32 Debug"
     release: FORCE
             nmake /f $(PROJECT).mak CFG="$(PROJECT) - Win32 Release"
     FORCE:

   and then you can simply change compile-command to `nmake'.

   Caleb T. Deupree reports that on VC++ 5.0 and up, "You can also set
an option in Options/Build to export a makefile every time the project
is saved, which you can then use to compile with `nmake -f
project.mak'."  VC++ 4.0 builds the make file every time, and there is
no option.

10.1.2.3 Reverting Buffers
..........................

It is recommended that you use `auto-revert-mode' in buffers that you
have open in both Emacs and MSVC++ at the same time.  Then if you
mistakenly edit the file in MSVC++, Emacs will pick up your changes
immediately, rather than after you have written lots more code and
attempt to save.


File: efaq-w32.info,  Node: Edit MSVC,  Prev: Reverting buffers,  Up: MSVC command line

10.1.2.4 Edit with Emacs function for MSVC
..........................................

You can also set up VC++ to import a file into Emacs for you, all ready
for editing.  In VC++, go to the `Tools' pull-down menu, and click on
`Customize...'.  In the `Tools' tab, click on `Add'.  Use `Browse' to
locate the `emacsclientw.exe' file in your Emacs bin directory, and
select it.  For arguments, use `+$(CurLine)' `"$(FilePath)"' and for
the directory use the `$(WkspDir)' (the quotes around FilePath handle
paths with spaces in them). Set the Menu Text to say "Em&acs". The
`+$(CurLine)' will set point in Emacs to the same line as the cursor
position in VC++. The ampersand in the word `Em&acs' allows you to
select emacs from the keyboard. (E is already used for the OLE control
test container.)

   You should now be able to go to any source file in your project.
Then, use the pull-down menu `Tools->Emacs'. The active file in your
VC++ IDE should now be front and center in Emacs, all ready to edit as
you wish. If you use keystrokes to work the menus, try `Alt-T A' to
move the file into Emacs. Binding this tool to a keystroke will be left
as an exercise for the student.

   If you have the option of saving files before running tools, make
sure this option is set. (I don't see it on VC++ 4.0.)

If you are using a graphical revision control tool already, check if it
comes with command-line tools.  Many such GUI tools are just wrappers

integration.  Most of the supported VC systems have well supported Free
native Windows binaries.  For those that don't Cygwin may be an option.

From Jay Rogers:

   Some versions of the perl debugger itself need to be patched to work
with emacs. They are perl versions 5.001 and less, and version
5.004_01. To fix, locate and change the code similar to the following
code in lib/perl5db.pl
             if (-e "/dev/tty") {
                 $console = "/dev/tty";
                 $rcfile=".perldb";
             }
             elsif (-e "con") {
                 $console = "";                 <---- change "con" to ""
                 $rcfile="perldb.ini";
             }
             else {
                 $console = "sys\$command";

Most of its tools can be used with Emacs, and it covers a wide range of
ported software.  The main shell used by Cygwin is GNU `bash', but
other shells are also available.  Some Cygwin tools may not
interoperate well with Emacs or other native Windows tools, due to the
total immersion aspect of Cygwin, including its non-native filesystem
mapping.

   If you choose to use Cygwin, then its tools will probably be all that
you need, but you will need to get image libraries from elsewhere, as
the Cygwin ones are not compatible with non-Cygwin software.  In fact,
if Cygwin is on your PATH when you run Emacs, and Emacs does not find
other versions of the image libraries first, then the Cygwin ones can
cause problems.  Cygwin developers recommend that you do not put Cygwin
on your system `PATH' for this reason.  Instead you can make the Cygwin
tools available within Emacs by setting `exec-path' in your init file.

11.2 MinGW and MSYS
===================

`http://www.mingw.org/'

   MinGW is a set of development tools that produce native Windows
executables, not dependent on Cygwin's POSIX emulation DLLs.

   MSYS is a POSIX shell and minimal set of tools that are commonly
used in configure scripts.  Like Cygwin, this environment uses a
non-native filesystem mapping to appear more POSIX like to the scripts
that it runs.  This is intended to complement the MinGW tools to make
it easier to port software to Windows.

11.3 UWIN
=========

`http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/uwin/'

   UWIN is another POSIX emulation environment, like Cygwin and MSYS,
that provides a large number of ported tools.  The shell used by UWIN
is `ksh', the Korn shell.

11.4 GnuWin32
=============

`http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/'

   GnuWin32 provides precompiled native Windows ports of a wide
selection of Free software and libraries.  Tools available here that
are useful for Emacs include:

   * Arc - used by `archive-mode' to edit .arc files.

   * Bzip2 - used by Emacs to automatically decompress .bz2 files.

   * CompFace - used by `gnus' to display XFace headers in messages.

   * CoreUtils - GNU file, shell and text utilities (also in MSYS)

   * DiffUtils - for `ediff' and producing patches

   * FindUtils - for `grep-find' and other file searches.

   * GifLib - library to support GIF images.

   * Grep - for searching through files with `grep'.

   * Gzip - used by Emacs to automatically decompress .gz files.

   * Jpeg - library to support JPEG images (also in GTK).

   * Lha - used by `archive-mode' to edit .lzh files.

   * LibPng - library to support PNG images (also in GTK).

   * LibTiff - library to support TIFF images (also in GTK).

   * Make - used by `compile' for building projects (also in MinGW)

   * OpenSSL - used by `gnus' to talk to servers over SSL.

   * Patch - used by `ediff-patch-file' and others to apply patches.

   * Tar - used by `tar-mode' to edit tar files.

   * TexInfo - used to build Emacs' manuals.

   * Unzip - used by `archive-mode' for extracting zip files.

   * Xpm - library to support XPM images (bundled with Emacs binaries)

   * Zip - used by `archive-mode' for editing zip files.

   * Zlib - required by LibPng (also in GTK).

11.5 GTK
========

GTK is a potential source for some of the image libraries that Emacs
requires.  GTK is installed along with other ports of GUI software,
such as the GIMP image editor, and Pidgin instant messenger client.  If
GTK is installed when you run `addpm', Emacs will use the image
libraries that it provides, even if they are not on the `PATH'.  GTK
ships with JPEG, PNG and TIFF support.

11.6 How do I read man pages?
=============================

Man pages for Emacs and other ported programs that you have can be read
using Emacs' built-in manual reader `woman'.  This requires no external
programs, but if you do have a port of `man', there is also an Emacs
wrapper `man' that which may be slightly faster.
