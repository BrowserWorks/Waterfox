The binaries have been built using Microsoft Visual C/C++ 6.0 SP6; they are
linked against the static single-threading runtime library and do not require
any additional runtime environment besides the basic Win32 system service dlls
supplied by every basic Windows installation.
The programs should run on every Windows version that supports 32-bit x86
executables: Windows 9x/ME, Windows NT3.x/NT4/2000/XP/2003/Vista/2008.
The Windows port of Zip 3.0 supports Unicode (UTF-8 coded) archive entry names;
on the "non-unicode" Windows variants 95/98/ME, this unicode support is limited
to the character subset supported by the active "single/double byte charcodes"
system codepage of the operating system.

The programs have been built without the optional assembler code for CRC-32
and the deflate inner loop.  Some coarse test resulted in the impression that
the performance of the standard C code seems to be better on modern CPUs
(Pentium 3, Pentium 4, etc...).  Additionally, the main Zip program has been
compiled with the optional bzip2 compression support enabled.
