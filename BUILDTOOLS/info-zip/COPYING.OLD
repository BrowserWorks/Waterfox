__________________________________________________________________________

   FIRST NOTE:
   This file contains some details about the copyright history of
   contributions to the UnZip project.
   Additionally, it summarises some exceptions to the general BSD-like
   copyright found in LICENSE that covers our generic code and most of
   the system specific ports.
   Please read LICENSE first to find out what is allowed to do with
   Info-ZIP's UnZip code.

   There are currently two explicit copyrights on portions of UnZip
   code (at least, of which Info-ZIP is aware):
   Jim Luther's Mac OS File Manager interface code; and Christopher Evans'
   MacBinaryIII coding code (for the MacOS port)..  These copyrights
   are discussed in more detail below.

   All remaining code is now (starting with UnZip version 5.41) covered
   by the new Info-ZIP license. For details, please read the acompaning
   file LICENSE. The terms and conditions in this license supersede the
   copyright conditions of the contributions by Igor Mandrichenko
   (vms/vms.c), Greg Roelofs (zipinfo.c, new version of unshrink.c),
   Mike White (Windows DLL code in "windll/*"), Steve P. Miller (Pocket
   UnZip GUI "wince/*"), and Mark Adler (inflate/explode decompresseion
   core routines, previously put into the public domain). All these
   Info-ZIP contributors (or "primary" authors) have permitted us to
   replace their copyright notes by the Info-ZIP License.

   Frequently Asked Questions regarding (re)distribution of Zip and UnZip
   are near the end of this file.

   There are no known patents on any of the code in UnZip.  Unisys
   claims a patent on LZW encoding and on LZW decoding _in an apparatus
   that performs LZW encoding_, but the patent appears to exempt a stand-
   alone decoder (as in UnZip's unshrink.c).  Unisys has publicly claimed
   otherwise, but the issue has never been tested in court.  Since this
   point is unclear, unshrinking is not enabled by default.  It is the
   responsibility of the user to make his or her peace with Unisys and
   its licensing requirements.  (unshrink.c may be removed from future
   releases altogether.)
__________________________________________________________________________

   The original unzip source code has been extensively modified and
   almost entirely rewritten (changes include random zipfile access
   rather than sequential; replacement of unimplode() with explode();
   replacement of old unshrink() with new (unrelated) unshrink(); re-
   placement of output routines; addition of inflate(), wildcards,
   filename-mapping, text translation, ...; etc.).  As far as we can
   tell, only the core code of the unreduce method remained substantially
   similar to Mr. Smith's original source.  As of UnZip 5.42, the complete
   core code is now covered by the Info-ZIP Licence.  Therefore, support
   for the reduce method has been removed.
   The drop of the reduce method should only affect some test archives,
   reducing was never used in any publically distributed Zip program.
   For pathologic cases where support for reduced archive entries is
   needed, the unreduce code copyrighted by Samuel H. Smith is available
   as a separate distribution (the restricted copyright of this code is
   cited below in the "historical" section).

   The following copyright applies to the Mac OS File Manager interface code

   The usage terms of this copyright note are compatible with the
   Info-ZIP license, they do not add further restrictions.

  This copyright note does not contain any usage terms.  So, we assume

   The remaining copyright notes have been superseeded by the new
   Info-ZIP license, with explicit permission from the respective
   original authors.  They are cited here for historical reasons,
   only:

   The following copyright applies to the full-featured unreduce.c
   (now distributed separately):

     * Copyright 1989 Samuel H. Smith;  All rights reserved
     *
     * Do not distribute modified versions without my permission.
     * Do not remove or alter this notice or any other copyright notice.
     * If you use this in your own program you must distribute source code.
     * Do not use any of this in a commercial product.

   Regarding the first stipulation, Mr. Smith was tracked down in southern
   California some years back [Samuel H. Smith, The Tool Shop; as of mid-
   May 1994, (213) 851-9969 (voice), (213) 887-2127(?) (subscription BBS),
   71150.2731@compuserve.com]:

   "He says that he thought that whoever contacted him understood that
    he has no objection to the Info-ZIP group's inclusion of his code.
    His primary concern is that it remain freely distributable, he said."

   Despite the fact that our "normal" code has been entirely rewritten
   and by default no longer contains any of Mr. Smith's code, Info-ZIP
   remains indebted and grateful to him.  We hope he finds our contribu-
   tions as useful as we have his.

   Note that the third and fourth stipulations still apply to any com-
   pany that wishes to incorporate the unreduce code into its products;
   if you wish to do so, you must contact Mr. Smith directly regarding
   licensing.

   The remaining code was written by many people associated with the
   Info-ZIP group, with large contributions from (but not limited to):
   Greg Roelofs (overall program logic, ZipInfo, unshrink, filename
   mapping/portability, etc.), Mark Adler (inflate, explode, funzip),
   Kai Uwe Rommel (OS/2), John Bush and Paul Kienitz (Amiga), Antoine
   Verheijen (Macintosh), Hunter Goatley (more VMS), Mike White (Windows
   DLLs), Christian Spieler (overall logic, optimization, VMS, etc.) and
   others.  See the file CONTRIBS in the source distribution for a much
   more complete list of contributors.
   The decompression core code for the deflate method (inflate.[ch],
   explode.c) was originally written by Mark Adler who submitted it
   as public domain code.
