    unzip.exe                   UnZip for NT command line utility, MSVC++ 7.1
    unzipsfx.exe                console mode SFX stub for NT, MSVC++ 7.1
    funzip.exe                  UnZip "filter" utility
    SFXWiz32.exe                GUI mode SFX stub for NT, MSVC++ 7.1
    unzipsfx-gcc.exe            console mode SFX stub for NT, gcc/mingw32
    SFXWiz32-gcc.exe            GUI mode SFX stub for NT, gcc/mingw32


The program executables were compiled with MS Visual C++ 7.1 (MSC v13.10),
using the win32/Makefile as supplied in the UnZip 6.0 source distribution
(with support for ASM_CRC enabled). Additionally, the sfx stubs have been
compressed by the free exe packer UPX 3.03.

The alternative unzipsfx-gcc.exe and SFXWiz32-gcc.exe stubs were compiled
by gcc 3.4.5 using the mingw32 environment. These stubs are significantly
smaller, but require the presence of the "msvcrt.dll" C runtime DLL.
Normally, this should not be a problem, since this dll is supplied as part
of the operating system core for Win2k/XP/2K3/Vista/2K8 and Windows 98/Me.
Older Windows systems (Win95/NT4) support this runtime DLL when Internet
Explorer 4.0 (or newer) is installed.
The dll is not supplied in a Win32s environment, but this should be a minor
problem. (For the text-mode stub this is not a problem at all; Win32s cannot
be used to run text-mode applications, anyway.)
