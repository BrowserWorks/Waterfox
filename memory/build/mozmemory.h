 * On some operating systems (Mac), we use madvise(MADV_FREE) to hand pages
 * back to the operating system.  On Mac, the operating system doesn't take
 * this memory back immediately; instead, the OS takes it back only when the
 * machine is running out of physical memory.
 *
 * This is great from the standpoint of efficiency, but it makes measuring our
 * actual RSS difficult, because pages which we've MADV_FREE'd shouldn't count
 * against our RSS.
 *
 * This function explicitly purges any MADV_FREE'd pages from physical memory,
 * causing our reported RSS match the amount of memory we're actually using.
 *
 * Note that this call is expensive in two ways.  First, it may be slow to
 * execute, because it may make a number of slow syscalls to free memory.  This
 * function holds the big jemalloc locks, so basically all threads are blocked
 * while this function runs.
 *
 * This function is also expensive in that the next time we go to access a page
 * which we've just explicitly decommitted, the operating system has to attach
 * to it a physical page!  If we hadn't run this function, the OS would have
 * less work to do.
 *
 * If MALLOC_DOUBLE_PURGE is not defined, this function does nothing.
