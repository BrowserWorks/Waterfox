# and the pattern rule is matched but doesn't resolve both sources, causing a
# failure.  Adding the SOURCES to GENERATED_FILES causes the sources
# to be built at export time, which is before MediaCodec.o needs them; and by
# the time MediaCodec.o is built, the source is in place and the VPATH
# resolution works as expected.
