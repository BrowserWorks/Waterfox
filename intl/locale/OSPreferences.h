/**
 * OSPreferences API provides a set of methods for retrieving information from
 * the host environment on topics such as:
 *   - Internationalization
 *   - Localization
 *   - Regional preferences
 *
 * The API is meant to remain as simple as possible, relaying information from
 * the host environment to the user without too much logic.
 *
 * Saying that, there are two exceptions to that paradigm.
 *
 * First one is normalization. We do intend to translate host environment
 * concepts to unified Intl/L10n vocabulary used by Mozilla.
 * That means that we will format locale IDs, timezone names, currencies etc.
 * into a chosen format.
 *
 * Second is caching. This API does cache values and where possible will
 * hook into the environment for some event-driven cache invalidation.
 *
 * This means that on platforms that do not support a mechanism to
 * notify apps about changes, new OS-level settings may not be reflected
 * in the app until it is relaunched.
