Welcome to the Firefox codebase!
--------------------------------

This page is here to help you get from "I want to build Firefox"
to "I'm building my own Firefox" to "I can contribute to Firefox". 
So if you'd like to help Mozilla build the best web browser in the
world, you're in the right place.

The Mozilla community prides itself on being an open, accessible, and
friendly community for new participants. If you have any difficulties
getting involved or finding answers to your questions, please `come and
ask your questions in our
chatroom <https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#introduction:mozilla.org>`_,
where we can help you get started.

We know even before you start contributing that getting set up to work
on Firefox and finding a bug that's a good fit for your skills can be a
challenge, and we're always looking for ways to improve this process: making
Mozilla more open, accessible, and easier to participate with. If you're
having any trouble following this documentation, or hit a barrier you
can't get around, please join us in the the Introduction room on Matrix
or contact Mike Hoye directly at mhoye@mozilla.com.
