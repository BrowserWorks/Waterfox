Firefox for Mobile Devices
--------------------------

We have several different mobile products aimed at different tasks,
devices, and audiences:

-  `Building Firefox for
   Android <https://geckoview.dev/contributor/geckoview-quick-start>`_.
   (Codename: Fennec)
-  `Building Firefox for iOS <https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_for_iOS>`_,
   our general-purpose browser for iOS with desktop sync built-in.
-  `Building Firefox
   Focus <https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus>`_, our
   privacy-focused browser for
   `iOS <https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-ios>`_ and
   `Android <https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android>`_.

For both Desktop and Mobile development, please bear the following in
mind:

-  While you can build Firefox on older hardware it can take quite a bit
   of time to compile on slower machines. Having at least 8GB of RAM is
   recommended, and more is always better. The build process is both CPU
   and I/O intensive, so building on a machine with an SSD is also
   strongly preferred.
-  Fast broadband internet is strongly recommended as well. Both the
   development environment and the source code repository are quite
   large.
-  Though you can build Firefox to run on 32-bit machines, the build
   process for almost all of our products requires a 64-bit OS.
