 *
 * @param aCallback    Callback function, called once per frame.
 * @param aSkipFrames  Number of initial frames to skip.  0 means that
 *                     the first callback will be for the caller of
 *                     MozStackWalk.
 * @param aMaxFrames   Maximum number of frames to trace.  0 means no limit.
 * @param aClosure     Caller-supplied data passed through to aCallback.
 * @param aThread      The thread for which the stack is to be retrieved.
 *                     Passing null causes us to walk the stack of the
 *                     current thread. On Windows, this is a thread HANDLE.
 *                     It is currently not supported on any other platform.
 * @param aPlatformData Platform specific data that can help in walking the
 *                      stack, this should be nullptr unless you really know
 *                      what you're doing! This needs to be a pointer to a
 *                      CONTEXT on Windows and should not be passed on other
 *                      platforms.
 *
 * May skip some stack frames due to compiler optimizations or code
 * generation.
