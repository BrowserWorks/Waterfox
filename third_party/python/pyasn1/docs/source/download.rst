Download & Install
==================

The *pyasn1* library is a pure-Python package with no external
dependencies. Considering how much industrial or finance software
can be stuck with an old platform (think RHEL 5), we struggle to
maintain its compatibility back to the very pre-historic Python
(which is 2.4!).

The best way to obtain PyASN1 is by running `pip`:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ virtualenv venv
   $ source venv/bin/activate
   $ pip install pyasn1

You may also want to use `pyasn1-modules`:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install pyasn1-modules

Alternatively, you can download the latest release from
`GitHub <https://github.com/etingof/pyasn1/releases>`_
or `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/pyasn1>`_.
