# Rust Image Release Notes

Rust image aims to be a pure-Rust implementation of various popular image formats. Accompanying reading/write support, rust image provides basic imaging processing function. See `README.md` for further details.

## Known issues
 - Images with *n* bit/channel (*n â‰  8*) are not well supported but basic
     support for 16-bit is available and implemented for PNG.
 - Not all Interlaced (progressive) or animated images are well supported.
 - The color space information of pixels is not clearly communicated.

## Changes

### Version 0.23.0

This major release intends to improve the interface with regards to handling of
color format data and errors for both decoding and encoding. This necessitated
many breaking changes anyways so it was used to improve the compliance to the
interface guidelines such as outstanding renaming.

It is not yet perfect with regards to color spaces but it was designed mainly
as an improvement over the current interface with regards to in-memory color
formats, first. We'll get to color spaces in a later major version.

- Heavily reworked `ColorType`:
  - This type is now used for denoting formats for which we support operations
      on buffers in these memory representations. Particularly, all channels in
      pixel types are assumed to be an integer number of bytes (In terms of the
      Rust type system, these are `Sized` and one can crate slices of channel
      values).
  - An `ExtendedColorType` is used to express more generic color formats for
      which the library has limited support but can be converted/scaled/mapped
      into a `ColorType` buffer. This operation might be fallible but, for
      example, includes sources with 1/2/4-bit components.
  - Both types are non-exhaustive to add more formats in a minor release.
  - A work-in-progress (#1085) will further separate the color model from the
      specific channel instantiation, e.g. both `8-bit RGB` and `16-bit BGR`
      are instantiations of `RGB` color model.
- Heavily rework `ImageError`:
  - The top-level enum type now serves to differentiate cause with multiple
      opaque representations for the actual error. These are no longer simple
      Strings but contains useful types. Third-party decoders that have no
      variant in `ImageFormat` have also been considered.
  - Support for `Error::source` that can be downcast to an error from a
      matching version of the underlying decoders. Note that the version is not
      part of the stable interface guarantees, this should not be relied upon
      for correctness and only be used as an optimization.
  - Added image format indications to errors.
  - The error values produced by decoder will be upgraded incrementally. See
      something that still produces plain old String messages? Feel free to
      send a PR.
- Reworked the `ImageDecoder` trait:
  - `read_image` takes an output buffer argument instead of allocating all
      memory on its own.
  - The return type of `dimensions` now aligns with `GenericImage` sizes.
  - The `colortype` method was renamed to `color_type` for conformity.
- The enums `ColorType`, `DynamicImage`, `imageops::FilterType`, `ImageFormat`
  no longer re-export all of their variants in the top-level of the crate. This
  removes the growing pollution in the documentation and usage. You can still
  insert the equivalent statement on your own:
  `use image::ImageFormat::{self, *};`
- The result of `encode` operations is now uniformly an `ImageResult<()>`.
- Removed public converters from some `tiff`, `png`, `gif`, `jpeg` types,
  mainly such as error conversion. This allows upgrading the dependency across
  major versions without a major release in `image` itself.
- On that note, the public interface of `gif` encoder no longer takes a
  `gif::Frame` but rather deals with `image::Frame` only. If you require to
  specify the disposal method, transparency, etc. then you may want to wait
  with upgrading but (see next change).
- The `gif` encoder now errors on invalid dimensions or unsupported color
  formats. It would previously silently reinterpret bytes as RGB/RGBA.
- The capitalization of  `ImageFormat` and other enum variants has been
  adjusted to adhere to the API guidelines. These variants are now spelled
  `Gif`, `Png`, etc. The same change has been made to the name of types such as
  `HDRDecoder`.
- The `Progress` type has finally received public accessor method. Strange that
  no one reported them missing.
- Introduced `PixelDensity` and `PixelDensityUnit` to store DPI information in
  formats that support encoding this form of meta data (e.g. in `jpeg`).

### Version 0.22.5

- Added `GenericImage::copy_within`, specialized for `ImageBuffer`
- Fixed decoding of interlaced `gif` files
- Prepare for future compatibility of array `IntoIterator` in example code

### Version 0.22.4

- Added in-place variants for flip and rotate operations.
- The bmp encoder now checks if dimensions are valid for the format. It would
  previously write a subset or panic.
- Removed deprecated implementations of `Error::description`
- Added `DynamicImage::into_*` which convert without an additional allocation.
- The PNG encoder errors on unsupported color types where it had previously
  silently swapped color channels.
- Enabled saving images as `gif` with `save_buffer`.

### Version 0.22.3

- Added a new module `io` containing a configurable `Reader`. It can replace
  the bunch of free functions: `image::{load_*, open, image_dimensions}` while
  enabling new combinations such as `open` but with format deduced from content
  instead of file path.
- Fixed `const_err` lint in the macro expanded implementations of `Pixel`. This
  can only affect your crate if `image` is used as a path dependency.

### Version 0.22.2

- Undeprecate `unsafe` trait accessors. Further evaluation showed that their
  deprecation should be delayed until trait `impl` specialization is available.
- Fixed magic bytes used to detect `tiff` images.
- Added `DynamicImage::from_decoder`.
- Fixed a bug in the `PNGReader` that caused an infinite loop.
- Added `ColorType::{bits_per_pixel, num_components}`.
- Added `ImageFormat::from_path`, same format deduction as the `open` method.
- Fixed a panic in the gif decoder.
- Aligned background color handling of `gif` to web browser implementations.
- Fixed handling of partial frames in animated `gif`.
- Removed unused direct `lzw` dependency, an indirect dependency in `tiff`.

### Version 0.22.1

- The required Rust version is now `1.34.2`.
- Note the website and blog: [image-rs.org][1] and [blog.image-rs.org][2]

  interface. Prefer iterating manually in the generic case.

- Always use custom struct for `ImageDecoder::Reader`
- Added `apply_without_alpha` and `map_without_alpha` to `Pixel` trait
- Pixel information now with associated constants instead of static methods
- Changed color structs to tuple types with single component. Improves
  ergonomics of destructuring assignment and construction.
- Add lifetime parameter on `ImageDecoder` trait.
- Remove unecessary `'static` bounds on affine operations
- Add function to retrieve image dimensions without loading full image
- Allow different image types in overlay and replace
- Iterators over rows of `ImageBuffer`, mutable variants
