/// yielded as they become ready. Streams will only be polled when they
/// generate notifications. This allows to coordinate a large number of streams.

/// Note that you can create a ready-made `SelectAll` via the
/// `select_all` function in the `stream` module, or you can start with an
/// empty set with the `SelectAll::new` constructor.
