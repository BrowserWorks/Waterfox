Rust bindings for `libclang`.

If you are interested in a Rust wrapper for these bindings, see
[clang-rs](https://github.com/KyleMayes/clang-rs).

Supported on the stable, beta, and nightly Rust channels.

## Supported Versions

To target a version of `libclang`, enable one of the following Cargo features:

* `clang_3_5` - requires `libclang` 3.5 or later
  ([Documentation](https://kylemayes.github.io/clang-sys/3_5/clang_sys))
* `clang_3_6` - requires `libclang` 3.6 or later
  ([Documentation](https://kylemayes.github.io/clang-sys/3_6/clang_sys))
* `clang_3_7` - requires `libclang` 3.7 or later
  ([Documentation](https://kylemayes.github.io/clang-sys/3_7/clang_sys))
* `clang_3_8` - requires `libclang` 3.8 or later
  ([Documentation](https://kylemayes.github.io/clang-sys/3_8/clang_sys))
* `clang_3_9` - requires `libclang` 3.9 or later
  ([Documentation](https://kylemayes.github.io/clang-sys/3_9/clang_sys))
* `clang_4_0` - requires `libclang` 4.0 or later
  ([Documentation](https://kylemayes.github.io/clang-sys/4_0/clang_sys))

If you do not enable one of these features, the API provided by `libclang` 3.5 will be available by
default.

## Dependencies

By default, this crate will attempt to link to `libclang` dynamically. In this case, this crate
depends on the `libclang` shared library (`libclang.so` on Linux, `libclang.dylib` on OS X,
`libclang.dll` on Windows). If you want to link to `libclang` statically instead, enable the
`static` Cargo feature. In this case, this crate depends on the LLVM and Clang static libraries. If
you don't want to link to `libclang` at compiletime but instead want to load it at runtime, enable
the `runtime` Cargo feature.

These libraries can be either be installed as a part of Clang or downloaded
[here](http://llvm.org/releases/download.html).

**Note:** This crate supports finding versioned instances of `libclang.so` (e.g.,
`libclang.so.3.9`). In the case where there are multiple instances to choose from, this crate will
prefer an unversioned instance first, then the version with the shortest and highest version. For
example, the following instances of `libclang.so` are listed in descending order of preference:

1. `libclang.so`
2. `libclang.so.4`
3. `libclang.so.4.0`
4. `libclang.so.3`
5. `libclang.so.3.9`

**Note:** The downloads for LLVM and Clang 3.8 and later do not include the `libclang.a` static
library. This means you cannot link to any of these versions of `libclang` statically unless you
build it from source.

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables, if set, are used by this crate to find the required libraries
and executables:

* `LLVM_CONFIG_PATH` **(compile time)** - provides a path to an `llvm-config` executable
* `LIBCLANG_PATH` **(compile time)** - provides a path to a directory containing a `libclang` shared
  library
* `LIBCLANG_STATIC_PATH` **(compile time)** - provides a path to a directory containing LLVM and
  Clang static libraries
* `CLANG_PATH` **(run time)** - provides a path to a `clang` executable

## Linking

### Dynamic

First, the `libclang` shared library will be searched for in the directory provided by the
`LIBCLANG_PATH` environment variable if it was set. If this fails, the directory returned by
`llvm-config --libdir` will be searched. If neither of these approaches is successful, a list of
likely directories will be searched (e.g., `/usr/local/lib` on Linux).

On Linux, running an executable that has been dynamically linked to `libclang` may require you to
add a path to `libclang.so` to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable. The same is true on OS
X, except the `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable is used instead.

On Windows, running an executable that has been dynamically linked to `libclang` requires that
`libclang.dll` can be found by the executable at runtime. See
[here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/7d83bc18.aspx) for more information.

### Static

The availability of `llvm-config` is not optional for static linking. Ensure that an instance of
this executable can be found on your system's path or set the `LLVM_CONFIG_PATH` environment
variable. The required LLVM and Clang static libraries will be searched for in the same way as the
shared library is searched for, except the `LIBCLANG_STATIC_PATH` environment variable is used in
place of the `LIBCLANG_PATH` environment variable.

### Runtime

The `clang_sys::load` function is used to load a `libclang` shared library for use in the thread in
which it is called. The `clang_sys::unload` function will unload the `libclang` shared library.
`clang_sys::load` searches for a `libclang` shared library in the same way one is searched for when
linking to `libclang` dynamically at compiletime.
