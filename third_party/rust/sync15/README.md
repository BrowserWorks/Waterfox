# Low-level sync-1.5 helper component

This component contains utility code to be shared between different
data stores that want to sync against a Firefox Sync v1.5 sync server.
It handles things like encrypting/decrypting records, obtaining and
using storage node auth tokens, and so-on.

It also needs a more complete README...
