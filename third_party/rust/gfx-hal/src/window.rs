//! Windowing system interoperability
//!
//! Screen presentation (fullscreen or window) of images requires two objects:
//!
//! * [Surface](window::Surface) is the host abstraction of the native screen
//! * [Swapchain](window::Swapchain) is the device abstraction for a surface, containing multiple presentable images
//!
//! ## Window
//!
//! // DOC TODO
//!
//! ## Surface
//!
//! // DOC TODO
//!
//! ## Swapchain
//!
//! The most interesting part of a swapchain are the contained presentable images/backbuffers.
//! Presentable images are specialized images, which can be presented on the screen. They are
//! 2D color images with optionally associated depth-stencil images.
//!
//! The common steps for presentation of a frame are acquisition and presentation:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # extern crate gfx_backend_empty as empty;
//! # extern crate gfx_hal;
//! # fn main() {
//! # use gfx_hal::prelude::*;
//!
//! # let mut swapchain: empty::Swapchain = return;
//! # let device: empty::Device = return;
//! # let mut present_queue: empty::CommandQueue = return;
//! # unsafe {
//! let acquisition_semaphore = device.create_semaphore().unwrap();
//! let render_semaphore = device.create_semaphore().unwrap();
//!
//! let (frame, suboptimal) = swapchain.acquire_image(!0, Some(&acquisition_semaphore), None).unwrap();
//! // render the scene..
//! // `render_semaphore` will be signalled once rendering has been finished
//! swapchain.present(&mut present_queue, 0, &[render_semaphore]);
//! # }}
//! ```
//!
//! Queues need to synchronize with the presentation engine, usually done via signalling a semaphore
//! once a frame is available for rendering and waiting on a separate semaphore until scene rendering
//! has finished.
