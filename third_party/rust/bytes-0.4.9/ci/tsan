# TSAN does not understand fences and `Arc::drop` is implemented using a fence.
# This causes many false positives.

# `std` mpsc is not used in any Bytes code base. This race is triggered by some
# rust runtime logic.

# Not sure why this is warning, but it is in the test harness and not the library.
