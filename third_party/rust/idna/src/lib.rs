//! This Rust crate implements IDNA
//! [per the WHATWG URL Standard](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#idna).
//!
//! It also exposes the underlying algorithms from [*Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing*
//! (Unicode Technical Standard #46)](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr46/)
//! and [Punycode (RFC 3492)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3492).
//!
//! Quoting from [UTS #46â€™s introduction](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr46/#Introduction):
//!
//! > Initially, domain names were restricted to ASCII characters.
//! > A system was introduced in 2003 for internationalized domain names (IDN).
//! > This system is called Internationalizing Domain Names for Applications,
//! > or IDNA2003 for short.
//! > This mechanism supports IDNs by means of a client software transformation
//! > into a format known as Punycode.
//! > A revision of IDNA was approved in 2010 (IDNA2008).
//! > This revision has a number of incompatibilities with IDNA2003.
//! >
//! > The incompatibilities force implementers of client software,
//! > such as browsers and emailers,
//! > to face difficult choices during the transition period
//! > as registries shift from IDNA2003 to IDNA2008.
//! > This document specifies a mechanism
//! > that minimizes the impact of this transition for client software,
//! > allowing client software to access domains that are valid under either system.
