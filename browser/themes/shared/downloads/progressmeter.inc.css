/*** Common-styled progressmeter ***/

/*
 * Styling "html:progress" is limited by the fact that a number of properties
 * are intentionally locked at the UA stylesheet level. We have to use a border
 * instead of an outline because the latter would be drawn over the progress
 * bar and we cannot change its z-index. This means we have to use a negative
 * margin, except when the value is zero, and adjust the width calculation for
 * the indeterminate state.
