# LOCALIZATION NOTE These strings are used inside the Performance Tools
# which is available from the Web Developer sub-menu -> 'Performance'.
# The correct localization of this file might be to keep it in
# English, or another language commonly spoken among web developers.
# You want to make that choice consistent across the developer tools.
# A good criteria is the language in which you'd find the best
# documentation on web development on the web. These strings
# are specifically for marker names in the performance tool.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (marker.label.*):
# These strings are displayed in the Performance Tool waterfall, identifying markers.
# We want to use the same wording as Google Chrome when appropriate.
marker.label.consoleTime=Consolă

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (marker.label.javascript.*):
# These strings are displayed as JavaScript markers that have special
# reasons that can be translated.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (marker.field.*):
# Strings used in the waterfall sidebar as property names.

# General marker fields

# General "reason" for a marker (JavaScript, Garbage Collection)
# General "type" for a marker (Cycle Collection, Garbage Collection)
# General "label" for a marker (user defined)

# Field names for stack values

# %S is the "Async Cause" of a marker, and this signifies that the cause
# was an asynchronous one in a displayed stack.

# For console.time markers

# For DOM Event markers

# Non-incremental cause for a Garbage Collection marker

# For "Recalculate Style" markers

# The type of operation performed by a Worker.

# The type of operation performed by a MessagePort

# Strings used in the waterfall sidebar as values.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (marker.gcreason.label.*):
# These strings are used to give a concise but readable description of a GC reason.

# The name of a nursery collection.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (marker.gcreason.description.*):
# These strings are used to give an expanded description of why a GC occurred.

marker.gcreason.description.FULL_GC_TIMER=JavaScript returned to the event loop, and it has been a relatively long time since we performed a garbage collection.
marker.gcreason.description.FULL_STORE_BUFFER=There were too many properties on tenured objects whose value was an object in the nursery.
marker.gcreason.description.INCREMENTAL_TOO_SLOW=A full, non-incremental garbage collection was triggered because there was a faster rate of allocations than the existing incremental garbage collection cycle could keep up with.
