# This should ideally match the string that OS X uses for the close button on alert-type
# notifications. OS X will truncate the value if it's too long.
# LOCALIZATION NOTE(actionButton.label): Used as the button label to provide more actions on OS X notifications. OS X will truncate this if it's too long.
# LOCALIZATION NOTE(webActions.disableForOrigin.label): %S is replaced
# with the hostname origin of the notification.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE(source.label): Used to show the URL of the site that
# sent the notification (e.g., "via mozilla.org"). "%1$S" is the source host
# and port.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE(doNotDisturb.label): %S is replaced with the
# brandShortName of the application.
