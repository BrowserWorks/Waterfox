# A good criteria is the language in which you'd find the best
# documentation on web development on the web.

# the resource name, %3$S is the line number, %4$S is the resource name, %5$S
# is the section name.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (fileChangedButNotManifest): the associated cache manifest
# references a URI that has a file modified after the cache manifest.
# Parameters: %1$S is the resource name, %2$S is the cache manifest, %3$S is
# the line number.
fileChangedButNotManifest=عُدّل الملف %1$S بعد %2$S. إن لم يتغير النص في ملف البيان ستُستخدم النسخة المخبّئة كبديل في السطر %3$S.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (cacheControlNoStore): the specified page has a header
# preventing caching or storing information. Parameters: %1$S is the resource

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (firstLineMustBeCacheManifest): the associated cache
# manifest has a first line that is not "CACHE MANIFEST". Parameters: %S is
# the line number.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (cacheManifestOnlyFirstLine2): the associated cache
# manifest has "CACHE MANIFEST" on a line other than the first line.
# Parameters: %S is the line number where "CACHE MANIFEST" appears.
cacheManifestOnlyFirstLine2=”‏CACHEMANIFEST“ صالحة في السطر الأول فقط و لكنها موجودة في السطر %S.

# where this error occurs.
slashDotDotSlashBad=/../ ليست بداية صحيحة للرابط في السطر %S.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (tooManyDotDotSlashes): the associated cache manifest has
# a URI containing too many ../ operators. Too many of these operators mean
# that the file would be below the root of the site, which is not possible.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (fallbackUseSpaces): the associated cache manifest has a
# FALLBACK section containing more or less than the standard two URIs
# separated by a single space. Parameters: %S is the line number where this
# error occurs.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (fallbackAsterisk2): the associated cache manifest has a

asteriskInWrongSection2=Asterisk (*) incorrectly used in the %1$S section at line %2$S. If a line in the NETWORK section contains only a single asterisk character, then any URI not listed in the manifest will be treated as if the URI was listed in the NETWORK section. Otherwise such URIs will be treated as unavailable. Other uses of the * character are prohibited.

badMimeType=Manifest has a mimetype of %S. Manifests must have a mimetype of text/cache-manifest.

fallbackAsterisk2=Asterisk (*) incorrectly used in the FALLBACK section at line %S. URIs in the FALLBACK section simply need to match a prefix of the request URI.

fallbackBlocksURI=FALLBACK section line %1$S (%2$S) prevents caching of line %3$S (%4$S) in the %5$S section.

fallbackUseSpaces=Only two URIs separated by spaces are allowed in the FALLBACK section at line %S.

firstLineMustBeCacheManifest=The first line of the manifest must be “CACHE MANIFEST” at line %S.

invalidSectionName=Invalid section name (%1$S) at line %2$S.
invalidURI=The URI passed to AppCacheUtils is invalid.

networkBlocksURI=NETWORK section line %1$S (%2$S) prevents caching of line %3$S (%4$S) in the %5$S section.
