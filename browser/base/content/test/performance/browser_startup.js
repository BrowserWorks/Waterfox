/* This test records at which phase of startup the JS components and modules
 * are first loaded.
 * If you made changes that cause this test to fail, it's likely because you
 * are loading more JS code during startup.
 * Most code has no reason to run off of the app-startup notification
 * (this is very early, before we have selected the user profile, so
 *  preferences aren't accessible yet).
 * If your code isn't strictly required to show the first browser window,
 * it shouldn't be loaded before we are done with first paint.
 * Finally, if your code isn't really needed during startup, it should not be
 * loaded before we have started handling user events.
