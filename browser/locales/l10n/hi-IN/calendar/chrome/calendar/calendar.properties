# LOCALIZATION NOTE (likelyTimezone):
#   Translators, please put the most likely timezone(s) where the people using
#   your locale will be.  Use the Olson ZoneInfo timezone name *in English*,
#   ie "Europe/Paris", (continent or ocean)/(largest city in timezone).
#   Order does not matter, except if two historically different zones now match,
#   such as America/New_York and America/Toronto, will only find first listed.
#   (Particularly needed to guess the most relevant timezones if there are
#    similar timezones at the same June/December GMT offsets with alphabetically
#    earlier ZoneInfo timezone names.  Sample explanations for English below.)
# for english-US:
#   America/Los_Angeles likelier than America/Dawson
#   America/New_York    likelier than America/Detroit (NY for US-EasternTime)
# for english:
#   Europe/London   likelier than Atlantic/Canary
#   Europe/Paris    likelier than Africa/Ceuta (for WestEuropeanTime)
#   America/Halifax likelier than America/Glace_Bay (Canada-AtlanticTime)
#   America/Mexico_City likelier than America/Cancun
#   America/Argentina/Buenos_Aires likelier than America/Araguaina
#   America/Sao_Paolo (may not recognize: summer-time dates change every year)
#   Asia/Singapore  likelier than Antarctica/Casey
#   Asia/Tokyo      likelier than Asia/Dili
#   Africa/Lagos likelier than Africa/Algiers (for WestAfricanTime)
#   Africa/Johannesburg likelier than Africa/Blantyre (for SouthAfricanStdTime)
#   Africa/Nairobi likelier than Africa/Addis_Ababa (for EastAfricanTime)
#   Australia/Brisbane likelier than Antarctica/DumontDUrville
#   Australia/Sydney likelier than Australia/Currie or Australia/Hobart
#   Pacific/Auckland likelier than Antarctica/McMurdo

# Guessed Timezone errors and warnings.
# Testing note:
# * remove preference for calendar.timezone.default in userprofile/prefs.js
# * repeat
#   - set OS timezone to a city (windows: click right on clock in taskbar)
#   - restart: sunbird -jsconsole
#   - observe guess in error console and verify whether guessed timezone city
#     makes sense for OS city.
#
# 'Warning: Operating system timezone "E. South America Standard Time"
#  no longer matches ZoneInfo timezone "America/Sao_Paulo".'
# Testing notes:
# - Brasil DST change dates are set every year by decree, so likely out of sync.
# - Only appears on OSes from which timezone can be obtained
#   (windows; or TZ env var, /etc/localtime target path, or line in
#    /etc/timezone or /etc/sysconfig/clock contains ZoneInfo timezone id).
# - Windows: turning off "Automatically adjust clock for daylight saving time"
#   can also trigger this warning.

# "Skipping Operating System timezone 'Pacific/New_Country'."
# Testing note: not easily testable.  May occur someday if (non-windows)
# OS uses different version of ZoneInfo database which has a timezone name
# that is not included in our current ZoneInfo database (or if the mapping
# mapping from windows to ZoneInfo timezone ids does).

# "Skipping locale timezone 'America/New_Yawk'."
# Testing note: Skipping occurs if a likelyTimezone id is unknown or misspelled.

# Testing note: "No match" timezones include Bucharest on W2k.
# Brazil timezones may be "No match" (change every year, so often out of date,
# and changes are often more than a week different).

# "Warning:  Using guessed timezone
#    America/New York (UTC-0500/-0400).
#    [rfc2445 summer daylight saving shift rules for timezone]
#  This ZoneInfo timezone almost matches/seems to match..."
#  This ZoneInfo timezone was chosen based on ... "

# Testing note: "Almost match" timezones include Cairo on W2k.
