# LOCALIZATION_NOTE(binaryComponentKnown): This is shown when Lightning is
# missing the binary component and knows how to calculate the expected version
# number. To test, remove the binary component from the components/
# subdirectory and start Lightning, or force install into a different
# Thunderbird version. In the last part of the sentence it should be made clear
# that the user can install e.g. 3.7, 3.7.1 or anything other 3.7.x version
# %1$S - The Lightning brand name, from the brandShortName string above.
# %2$S - The current Lightning version

# LOCALIZATION_NOTE(binaryComponentUnknown): This is shown when Lightning is
# missing the binary component but can't calculate the expected version. This
# happens in the rare case that Lightning is installed into something other
# than Thunderbird or Seamonkey. You may link to a different page if you can
# commit to keeping it up to date, I'd recommend staying with the English page.
# %1$S - The Lightning brand name, from the brandShortName string above.

# to a Thunderbird that has Lightning packaged. See bug 1130852 for details.

# LOCALIZATION_NOTE(integrationRestartLabel): At the current time its not yet
# clear if we will be completely uninstalling Lightning or disabling it. Please

# options.
