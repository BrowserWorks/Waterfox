#  how many messages we are displaying in the list out of the total number of
#  messages in the active set (the set of messages remaining after the
#  application of the facet constraints.)
# The goal of the various sub-parts here is to make a label along the lines of
#  "M of N".  Because there are two numbers, this is split into two parts,
#  'NMessages' for what in English is just the first number and 'ofN' for the
#  "of N" part.  We then use 'grouping' to decide how to combine the two. This
#  was suggested by Rimas Kudelis.
# LOCALIZATION NOTE(glodaFacetView.results.header.countLabel.NMessages):
#  The first part of the countLabel string (although you can change the order
#  in 'grouping').  This is pluralized using the mechanism described at

#  "#1" with the number of messages being shown in the result list.

# trailing whitespace is trimmed before it gets to the code.

# has 5 recipients, we might only show the first 3, and then use this label
# to indicate that there are 2 that are not displayed.  This string can be
# pluralized; see https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Localization_and_Plurals
# for details on how to do that. Note that in English, we use the "serial
# comma", but other languages may not need a leading separator there.
