                          Getting SeaMonkey

==========================================================================

You can download nightly builds of SeaMonkey from the mozilla.org FTP site
at

  http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/seamonkey/nightly/

For the very latest builds, see

  http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/seamonkey/nightly/latest-trunk/

Keep in mind that nightly builds, which are used by mozilla.org developers
for testing, may be buggy. If you are looking for a more polished version
of SeaMonkey, the SeaMonkey project releases builds of SeaMonkey regularly
that you can download from

  http://www.seamonkey-project.org/releases/

Be sure to read the SeaMonkey release notes for information on known
problems and installation issues with SeaMonkey.  The release notes can be
found at the preceding URL along with the releases themselves.

                      Installation Instructions

==========================================================================

Note that the installation instructions use the bash shell. If you're not
using bash, adjust the commands accordingly.

Install into a clean (new) directory.
Installing on top of previously released builds may cause problems.

Note: These instructions do not tell you how to build SeaMonkey.
For info on building SeaMonkey from the mozilla.org source code, see

  http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Build_Documentation


Installation Instructions
-------------------------------

  Note: There is no installer available, but just extracting the tar.bz2
  to the default directory (usually /usr/local/seamonkey) achieves the
  same result as an installer would.

  To install SeaMonkey by downloading the tar.bz2 file:

  1. Create a directory named "seamonkey" (mkdir seamonkey) and change
     to that directory (cd seamonkey).

  2. Click the link on the site you're downloading SeaMonkey from to
     download the package (seamonkey*.tar.bz2) file into the seamonkey
     directory.

  3. Change to the seamonkey directory (cd seamonkey) and decompress the
     file with the following command:

       tar jxvf sea*.tar.bz2

     This creates a "seamonkey" directory under your seamonkey directory.

  4. Change to the seamonkey directory (cd seamonkey).

  5. Run SeaMonkey with the following run script:

    ./seamonkey


  To hook up SeaMonkey complete with icon to the GNOME Panel,
  follow these steps:

  1. Click the GNOME Main Menu button, open the Panel menu, and then open
     the Add to Panel submenu and choose Launcher.

  2. Right-click the icon for SeaMonkey on the Panel and enter the
     following command:

       directory_name./seamonkey

     where directory_name is the name of the directory you downloaded
     SeaMonkey to. For example, the default directory that SeaMonkey
     suggests is /usr/local/seamonkey.

  3. Type in a name for the icon, and type in a comment if you wish.

  4. Click the icon button and type in the following as the icon's location:

       directory_name/chrome/icons/default/default.png

     where directory_name is the directory where you installed SeaMonkey.
     For example, the default directory is
     /usr/local/seamonkey/chrome/icons/default/default.png.
