# LOCALIZATION NOTE (searchWithEngine, searchInPrivateWindowWithEngine): %S will
# be replaced with the search engine provider's name. This format was chosen
# because the provider can also end with "Search" (e.g.: MSN Search).
searchWithEngine = Søk med %S

searchInPrivateWindowWithEngine = Søk med %S i eit privat vindauge

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (searchInPrivateWindow): Used when the private browsing
# engine is the same as the default engine.
searchInPrivateWindow = Søk i eit privat vindauge

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (switchToTab2): This is the same as the older switchToTab
# string that it's replacing, except it uses title case, so "Switch" and "Tab"
# are capitalized.
switchToTab2 = Byt til fane

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (visit): This is shown next to autocomplete entries that are
# simple URLs or sites, which will be visited when the user selects them.
visit = Gå til

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (bookmarkKeywordSearch): This is the title of autocomplete
# entries that are bookmark keyword searches.  %1$S will be replaced with the
# domain name of the bookmark, and %2$S will be replaced with the keyword
# search text that the user is typing.  %2$S will not be empty.
bookmarkKeywordSearch = %1$S: %2$S
