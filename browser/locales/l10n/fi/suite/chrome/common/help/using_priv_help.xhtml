<p>A cookie is a small amount of information on your computer that is used by
  some websites. For a brief overview, see
  <a href="privacy_help.xhtml#what_are_cookies_and_how_do_they_work">What Are
  Cookies and How Do They Work?</a></p>

<p>Before loading a web page that uses cookies, your browser handles the
  page&apos;s cookies by doing two things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Accepts or rejects any requests by the website to <strong>set</strong>
    (store) one or more cookies on your computer.</li>
  <li>Accepts or rejects any requests by the website to <strong>read</strong>
    cookies it previously stored on your computer. A website can&apos;t
    actually read cookies or any other data on your computer&mdash;instead,
    your browser gets the cookies and sends them back to the website.</li>

    the list.)</li>
</ol>

<p>Cookies help websites keep track of information for you, such as the
  contents of your on-line shopping cart or which cities&apos; weather you want
  to know about. For a brief overview, see
  <a href="privacy_help.xhtml#what_are_cookies_and_how_do_they_work">What Are
  Cookies and How Do They Work?</a></p>

<p>You can select one of these options:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Block cookies</strong>: Select this option to refuse all
    cookies.</li>
  <li><strong>Allow cookies for the originating website only</strong>: Select
    this option if you don&apos;t want to accept or return
    <a href="privacy_help.xhtml#what_are_third-party_cookies">foreign
    cookies</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Allow all cookies</strong>: This is the default option. Select
    this option to permit all websites not explicitly blocked to set cookies on
    your computer.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Blocking cookies does not remove old cookies. By
  blocking cookies you only block websites from setting new cookies, and old
  cookies will still be sent to websites. To completely block a website from
  receiving old cookies, you need to <a href="#removing_cookies">remove its
  cookies</a>.
</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: <a href="#cookie_sites">Per-website cookie permission</a>
  supersedes default cookie setting. For example, if you allow a website to set
  cookies, the website can set cookies even if you choose <q>Block cookies</q>.
</p>

<p>If you allow cookies or do not change the default setting, you can also
  select the following preferences:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Accept cookies normally</strong>: Select this

    then type the number of days.</li>
  <li><strong>Ask for each cookie</strong>: Select this if you want
    Cookie Manager to warn you each time a website is about to store a cookie.
    In addition, you can choose <strong>except for session cookies</strong>: so
    that &brandShortName; will not warn you if the website is setting cookies
    which will be deleted when you exit your browser.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also get more information about your stored cookies:</p>

<h1 id="using_the_password_manager">Using the Password Manager</h1>

<p>Many websites require you to type a user name and password before you can
  enter the website. For instance, personalized pages and websites containing
  your financial information usually require you to log in.</p>

<p>The user name and password you use at a particular website can be read by the
  site&apos;s administrator. Potentially, that person could then attempt to log
  into other websites where you may have used the same user name and password.
  If this concerns you, you may wish to use a different password at every
  website with which you register.</p>

<p>Password Manager can help you remember some or all of your names and
  passwords by storing them on your computer&apos;s hard disk, and entering
  them for you automatically when you visit such websites.</p>

<div class="contentsBox">In this section:

</div>

<h2 id="using_password_manager_to_remember_user_names_and_passwords">Using
  Password Manager to Remember User Names and Passwords</h2>

<p>When Password Manager is active (as it is by default), it gives you an
  opportunity to save user names and passwords on your hard drive that you
  enter while using the Internet.</p>

<p>For example, after you log onto a website from a page that requests a user
  name and password, a dialog box appears asking, <q>Do you want Password
  Manager to remember this logon?</q> When you see this dialog box, you can
  click one of the following buttons:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Yes</strong>: The next time you return to the website you&apos;ll
    see that your user name and password are already filled in. All you have to
    do is click the Login button (or equivalent) to send them to the
    server.</li>
  <li><strong>Never for this site</strong>: Password Manager will not ask in
    the future if you want to save your user name and password for that
    website.</li>
  <li><strong>No</strong>: Password Manager won&apos;t remember the user name
    and password, but will ask again the next time you visit the website.</li>
</ul>

<p>Similarly, when you log onto an email account or an FTP site, or perform any
  other action that requires the browser itself to display a special dialog box
  for your login information, you can select this option in the dialog box:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Use Password Manager to remember these values</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The next time you check your email or perform other tasks that require a
  password only, the password will be submitted directly without any further
  action on your part. For tasks that require you to enter both a user name and
  password, you need to click a Login button or equivalent after Password
  Manager fills in the information.</p>

<p>Password Manager saves your user names and passwords on your own computer in
  a file that&apos;s difficult, but not impossible, for an intruder to read.
  See <a href="#encrypting_stored_sensitive_information">Encrypting Stored
  Sensitive Information</a> for information on protecting your stored user
  names and passwords with encryption technology.</p>

<p>If the Password Manager dialog box described above does not appear when you
  click Submit after typing your user name and password, Password Manager may
  be turned off or the website may disallow its use.</p>

<p>To check whether Password Manager is currently active, see
  <a href="#turning_password_manager_on_and_off">Turning Password Manager On
  and Off</a>.</p>

<p>[<a href="#using_the_password_manager">Return to beginning of
  section</a>]</p>

<h2 id="entering_user_names_and_passwords_automatically">Entering User Names
  and Passwords Automatically</h2>

<p>There are two different ways that Password Manager can fill in user names
  and passwords on your behalf:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You use Password Manager to remember your user name and password for a
    website (using the three-button dialog box described in
    <a href=
    "#using_password_manager_to_remember_user_names_and_passwords">Using
    Password Manager to Remember User Names and Passwords</a>).

    <p>The next time you visit the website, Password Manager automatically fills
      in your user name and password on the website&apos;s log in page. You can
      then click the Login button, or equivalent, to send the information to
      the server.</p>
  </li>
  <li>You use Password Manager to remember your user name and password for an
    email account, an FTP site, or in any other situation where you type login
    information in a dialog box that displays a checkbox labeled <q>Use
    Password Manager to remember these values</q>.

    <p>In most cases, the next time you attempt to access that server, Password
      Manager automatically fills in your user name and password in the same
      dialog box. You can then click OK to send the information to the
      server.</p>

    <p>In some cases, such as when you open your email account,
      &brandShortName; needs to send only the password to the server, and does
      so immediately without displaying the dialog box or requiring any further
      action on your part.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>[<a href="#using_the_password_manager">Return to beginning of
  section</a>]</p>

<h2 id="turning_password_manager_on_and_off">Turning Password Manager On and
  Off</h2>

<p>Password Manager is on by default. To turn it off:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the <span class="mac">&brandShortName;</span>
    <span class="noMac">Edit</span> menu and choose Preferences.</li>
  <li>Under the Privacy &amp; Security category, click Passwords. (If no
    subcategories are visible, double-click Privacy &amp; Security to expand
    the list.)</li>
  <li>In the Password Manager section, deselect <q>Remember passwords</q>
    to turn Password Manager off.</li>
</ol>

<p>To turn Password Manager on, follow steps 1 and 2 above, but select the
  checkbox in step 3 rather than deselecting it.</p>

<p>[<a href="#using_the_password_manager">Return to beginning of
  section</a>]</p>

<h2 id="viewing_and_managing_stored_passwords">Viewing and Managing Stored
  Passwords</h2>

<p>To see the user names and passwords you have stored and to display a list of
  websites from which logon information never is saved:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Open the Tools menu, choose Password Manager, and then choose Manage
    Stored Passwords from the submenu. You see the Password Manager window with
    the Passwords Saved tab opened.
    <ul>
      <li>To see your saved passwords, click Show Passwords and confirm your
        choice.</li>
      <li>To hide your passwords, click Hide Passwords.</li>
      <li>To remove an entry from the list, click it and then click Remove. The
        next time you visit the website, you will need to enter your user name
        and password again, since Password Manager will no longer have the
        information.</li>
    </ul>
    Click the Passwords Never Saved tab to see a list of the websites for which
    you instructed Password Manager never to store user names and passwords. To
    remove a website from this list, click it and then click Remove. The next
    time you log into the website, you can use the stored user name and
    password (if available) or indicate that you want Password Manager to save
    the information for that website.</li>
</ul>

<p>[<a href="#using_the_password_manager">Return to beginning of
  section</a>]</p>

<h1 id="encrypting_stored_sensitive_information">Encrypting Stored Sensitive
  Information</h1>

<p>If you use Password Manager to save passwords, then this sensitive
  information is stored on your computer in a file that&apos;s difficult, but
  not impossible, for an intruder to read.</p>

<p>For example, if your computer is in an area where unauthorized people have
  access to it, it&apos;s possible for a determined person to read the file
  containing your sensitive information.</p>

<p>For a greater degree of security, you may want to protect the file with
  encryption. Encryption makes it much harder for an unauthorized person to
  view your stored sensitive information.</p>

<p>Your decision about whether to use encryption for stored sensitive data is a
  tradeoff between improved security and convenience.</p>

<p>If you use encryption, you will need to enter a master password
  periodically, which can be inconvenient. If you don&apos;t, it may be easier
  for a stranger who has access to your computer to steal your passwords.</p>

<h2 id="logging_out_of_your_master_password">Logging Out of Your Master
  Password</h2>

<p>Normally, you are asked for your master password once during each
  &brandShortName; session during which you access any of your stored sensitive
  information.</p>

<p>It&apos;s also possible to require that your master password be requested
  each time it is needed, or after a certain amount of time has passed. For
  details, see <a href="passwords_help.xhtml#master_password_timeout">Master
  Password Timeout</a>.</p>

<p>You can log out of your master password so that it must be entered again
  before any sensitive information can be stored or retrieved. This is useful
  if you are going to leave your computer unattended for a period of time.</p>

<p>To log out of your master password:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the Tools menu and choose Password Manager.</li>
  <li>Select Log Out from the submenu.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="what_to_do_if_you_forget_your_master_password">What to Do If You Forget
  Your Master Password</h2>

<p>If you forget your master password, you won&apos;t be able to access any of
  the stored password it protects. Your master password is your most important
  password. Make sure you remember it or record it in a safe place.</p>

<p>As a last resort, it&apos;s possible to reset your master password if you
  are sure you can&apos;t remember it. However, resetting your master password
  permanently erases all the web and email passwords, saved on your behalf by
  Password Manager. You will also lose all your personal certificates
  associated with the
  <a href="glossary.xhtml#software_security_device">Software Security
  Device</a>.</p>

<p>Before taking this drastic step, read
  <a href="passwords_help.xhtml#reset_master_password">Reset Master
  Password</a>.</p>

<p>If you are sure you can&apos;t remember or retrieve your master password,
  follow these instructions to reset it:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the <span class="mac">&brandShortName;</span>
    <span class="noMac">Edit</span> menu and choose Preferences.</li>
  <li>Under the Privacy &amp; Security category, click Master Passwords. (If no

<h1 id="managing_images">Managing Images</h1>

<p>If you wish, you can choose not to download any images when you browse the
  web. This greatly restricts what you can view online, but may be helpful if
  you have a slow connection and wish to shorten the time it takes web pages to
  load.</p>

<p>You can also control how frequently animated images repeat their animation,
  or turn off animation completely.</p>

<p>The next section describes how to control these image settings. The default
  settings allow all images to be accepted and allow them to repeat their
  animation.</p>

<h2 id="images">Privacy &amp; Security Preferences - Images</h2>

<p>This section describes how to set preferences for images. To view the
  preference settings for images:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the <span class="mac">&brandShortName;</span>
    <span class="noMac">Edit</span> menu and choose Preferences.</li>
  <li>Under the Privacy &amp; Security category, click Images. (If no
    subcategories are visible, double-click Privacy &amp; Security to expand
    the list.)</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="image_acceptance_policy">Image Acceptance Policy</h3>

<p>Image Acceptance preferences allow you to control whether or under what
  conditions the &brandShortName; browser should display images:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Do not load any images</strong>: Select this option if you do not
    want the &brandShortName; browser to display images.</li>
  <li><strong>Accept images that come from the originating server
    only</strong>: Select this option if you do not want to load images from
    third-party websites.</li>
  <li><strong>Accept all images</strong>: Select this option if you want to
    display all images. (This option is selected by default.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Animated images should loop</h3>

<p>These settings control how many times animated images repeat their
  animation:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>As many times as the image specifies</strong>: Select this if you
    want image animation to repeat as many times as specified within each
    image. (This option is selected by default.)</li>
  <li><strong>Once</strong>: Select this if you want image animation to occur
    once, overriding the number of times specified within each image.</li>
  <li><strong>Never</strong>: Select this if you do not want image
    animation.</li>
</ul>
