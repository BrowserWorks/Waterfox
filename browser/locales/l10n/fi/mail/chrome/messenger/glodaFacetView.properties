# This label is displayed above the list of result messages; it tells the user
#  how many messages we are displaying in the list out of the total number of
#  messages in the active set (the set of messages remaining after the
#  application of the facet constraints.)
# The goal of the various sub-parts here is to make a label along the lines of
#  "M of N".  Because there are two numbers, this is split into two parts,
#  'NMessages' for what in English is just the first number and 'ofN' for the
#  "of N" part.  We then use 'grouping' to decide how to combine the two. This
#  was suggested by Rimas Kudelis.
# LOCALIZATION NOTE(glodaFacetView.results.header.countLabel.NMessages):
#  The first part of the countLabel string (although you can change the order
#  in 'grouping').  This is pluralized using the mechanism described at
#  https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Localization_and_Plurals.  We replace
#  "#1" with the number of messages being shown in the result list.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE(glodaFacetView.results.header.countLabel.ofN):
#  The second part of the countLabel string (although you can change the order

# LOCALIZATION NOTE(glodaFacetView.results.message.recipientSeparator): This is

# trailing whitespace is trimmed before it gets to the code.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE(glodaFacetView.results.message.andOthers):
# When a message has too many recipients, we only show the first few and then
# display this label to express how many are not displayed.  So if a message
# has 5 recipients, we might only show the first 3, and then use this label
# to indicate that there are 2 that are not displayed.  This string can be
# pluralized; see https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Localization_and_Plurals
# for details on how to do that. Note that in English, we use the "serial
# comma", but other languages may not need a leading separator there.
