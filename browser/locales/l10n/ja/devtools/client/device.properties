# LOCALIZATION NOTE These strings are used inside Device Emulation developer
# tools. The correct localization of this file might be to keep it in English,
# or another language commonly spoken among web developers.  You want to make
# that choice consistent across the developer tools.  A good criteria is the
# language in which you'd find the best documentation on web development on the
# web.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE:
# These strings are category names in a list of devices that a user can choose
# to simulate (e.g. "ZTE Open C", "VIA Vixen", "720p HD Television", etc).
