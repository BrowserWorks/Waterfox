<h3 id="client_certificate_selection">Client Certificate Selection</h3>

<p>Some websites require you to identify yourself with a certificate. The
  option you select here determines how the browser identifies the certificate
  to present among those you may have on file:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Select Automatically:</strong> Click this option if you want
    the browser to select a certificate without asking you.</li>
  <li><strong>Ask Every Time:</strong> Click this option if you want the browser
    to ask you which certificate to use each time a website requests one.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="manage_certificates">Manage Certificates</h3>

<p>Certificates are the digital equivalent of ID cards&mdash;they help other
  people identify you, and they help you identify other people, websites, and
  organizations.</p>

<p>To examine or configure the certificates you have on file, click Manage
  Certificates. See <a href="using_certs_help.xhtml#managing_certificates">Managing
  Certificates</a> for further information on this dialog.</p>

<h3 id="manage_security_devices">Manage Security Devices</h3>

<p>A security device is a hardware or software device that stores your
  certificates and keys. For example, a smart card is a security device. Your
  browser has its own built-in software security device, and you can use
  additional security devices, such as smart cards, at the same time.</p>

<p>To examine or configure your security devices, click Manage Security
  Devices. See <a href="using_certs_help.xhtml#managing_smart_cards_and_other_security_devices">Managing
  Smart Cards and Other Security Devices</a> for further information on
  this dialog.</p>

<h3 id="ocsp">OCSP</h3>

<p>A certificate revocation list (CRL) is a list of revoked certificates that
  is generated and signed by a
  <a href="glossary.xhtml#certificate_authority">certificate authority
  (CA)</a>. The Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) makes it possible for
  Certificate Manager to perform an online check of a certificate&apos;s
  validity each time the certificate is viewed or used. This process involves
  checking the certificate against a CRL maintained at a server specified by
  the CA of that certificate. Your computer must be online for OCSP to work.</p>

<p>The following settings in the OCSP section of the Certificates preferences
  panel determine how Certificate Manager uses OCSP:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Use the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) to confirm the
    current validity of certificates</strong>: Select this if you want
    Certificate Manager to perform an online status check each time it verifies
    a certificate. Certificate Manager makes sure that the certificate is
    listed as valid at the URL and checks validity period and trust settings.

    <p><strong>Note</strong>: If this setting is not selected, Certificate
      Manager will only confirm the certificate&apos;s validity period and that
      it is correctly signed by a CA whose own CA certificate is both listed
      under the CA Certificates tab (in the main Certificate Manager window)
      and marked as trusted for issuing that kind of certificate.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>When an OCSP server connection fails, treat the certificate as
    invalid</strong>: Select this if you want the validation to fail if a
    connection to the OCSP server can&apos;t be established, thus enforcing
    that a certificate always must be positively validated for each use.</li>
</ul>

  <a href="using_certs_help.xhtml#controlling_validation">How Certificate
  Validation Works</a>.</p>
