<h2 id="about_address_books">About Address Books</h2>

<p>Address books store email addresses and contact information for people you
  typically send mail to, such as colleagues, friends, and family.
  &brandShortName; Mail &amp; Newsgroups provides you with two address books:
  the Personal Address Book and the Collected Addresses&mdash;and you can
  create additional address books as well. You can also import address books
  from other mail programs and previous versions of &brandShortName;. The
  contents of these address books are stored locally on your hard disk.</p>

<p>Your address book may also list email addresses from an LDAP directory,
  which is located on an LDAP directory server. The directory server stores
  email addresses of people that are not included in your locally-stored
  address books. The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is an
  industry-standard method for accessing Internet or intranet directory
  services such as corporate address books.</p>

<h4>Personal Address Book</h4>

<p>Use the Personal Address Book to add specific names of your choice. You can
  create mailing lists and edit individual address entries.</p>

<h4>Collected Addresses</h4>

<p>By default, the Collected Addresses automatically collects the email
  addresses contained in outgoing mail messages. Addresses from outgoing
  messages are stored in the Collected Addresses as soon as you click Send.</p>

<h4>LDAP Directory (if available)</h4>

<p>An LDAP directory (also known as an address lookup service) stores email
  addresses of recipients who are not in your locally-stored address books.
  LDAP directories offer you access to large, centrally maintained databases
  of email addresses, which is especially useful with
  <a href="mailnews_preferences.xhtml#address_autocompletion">address
  autocompletion</a>.</p>

<p>Automatic address collection is enabled by default. To change automatic
  address collection settings, begin in the Mail window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the <span class="mac">&brandShortName;</span>
    <span class="noMac">Edit</span> menu and choose Preferences.</li>
  <li>Under the Mail &amp; Newsgroups category, click Addressing. (If no
    subcategories are visible, double-click Mail &amp; Newsgroups to expand the
    list.)</li>
  <li>Under Email Address Collection, select <q>Add email addresses to my</q>
    and choose whether you want:
    <ul>
      <li>Personal Address Book.</li>
      <li>Collected Addresses.</li>

  prefers to receive plain-text or HTML-formatted messages.</p>

<p>To create an address book card for an individual:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click the Address Book icon on the status bar or open the Window menu and
    choose Address Book.</li>
  <li>Click New Card. (If you have multiple address books, select the one to
    which you want to add a card.)</li>
  <li>Each New Card dialog box has three tabs:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Contact</strong>: Enter the following information:
        <ul>
          <li>First and Last (first and last name of person as you want it to
            appear in the address book).</li>
          <li>Display name (the name that appears in the <q>To</q> field of the
            Compose window).</li>
          <li>Nickname (a shortcut or alias for the real name).</li>
          <li>Email address (primary and additional address).</li>
          <li>Prefers to receive messages formatted as: If you know this
            recipient can read HTML-formatted messages (such as messages that
            include links, images, or tables), choose HTML. If this recipient
            can only read messages sent as plain text (no formatting), then
            choose Plain Text. If you don&apos;t know or are not sure, choose
            Unknown. If you choose Unknown, &brandShortName; Mail &amp;
            Newsgroups determines the sending format based on the Mail &amp;
            Newsgroups Send Format settings in the Preferences dialog box. If
            Mail &amp; Newsgroups still can&apos;t determine the correct
            format, Mail &amp; Newsgroups will prompt you to choose a sending
            format when you send the message.</li>
          <li>Allow remote images in HTML mail: If you want to allow this
            sender to have remote content they send you displayed in your
            message window.</li>

<p>If you have a &brandShortName; address book from another user profile or
  computer, or if you have an address book from another mail program, you can
  import its entries into the Address Book window as a new address book. Keep
  in mind that when you upgrade a user profile from an earlier version of
  &brandShortName;, your address books are automatically included, so
  there&apos;s no need to import them.</p>

<p>You can import address books from Netscape 6, Netscape 7, Outlook,
  Outlook Express, or text files (LDIF, tab-delimited (.tab), comma-separated
  (.csv), or text (.txt) formats). When you import an address book, Mail &amp;
