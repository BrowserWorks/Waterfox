## Signature Information strings
SINoneLabel=Message Has No Digital Signature
SINone=این پیام شامل امضای دیجیتالی ارسال کننده نیست. نبودن یک امضای دیجیتالی یعنی پیام می‌تواند توسّط شخصی که تظاهر به داشتن این آدرس پست الکترونیکی میکند ارسال شده باشد. همچنین این امکان وجود دارد که پیام در زمانی که روی شبکه متنقل میشده، تغییر داده شده باشد. هرچند، این بعید است که چنین چیزی رخ داده باشد.
