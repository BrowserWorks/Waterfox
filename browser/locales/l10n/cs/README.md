# Mozilla l10n-central - Czech (cs) localization

This repository contains Czech localization files for Mozilla desktop products
(Firefox, Thunderbird, SeaMonkey), Lightning calendar add-on, ChatZilla add-on
and Waterfox for Android. Other products, web applications and some Waterfox
features (system add-ons) have their own repositories. You can find them listed
in our translation interface called Pontoon.

## How to get involved
