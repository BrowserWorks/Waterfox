# LOCALIZATION NOTE (glodaFacetView.tab.query.label):
#  The tab title to display for tabs that are based on a gloda (global database)

#  and explain what the query/collection is in automatic fashion, but not today.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (glodaFacetView.tab.search.label):
#  The tab title to display for tabs with a new gloda (global database)

#  After the search has been started, we just display the search string entered
#  by the user.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (glodaFacetView.facets.mode.top.listAllLabel): The label to
#  use when we are only displaying the top entries for a facet.  When the
#  label is clicked on, it results in us displaying all of the values for that
#  facet.  The value "#1" (if present) is replaced with the total number of

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (glodaFacetView.facets.filter.attachmentTypes.allLabel):
#  The label to use when all types of attachments are being displayed.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (glodaFacetView.result.message.fromLabel): Used in the

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (glodaFacetView.result.message.toLabel): Used in the

# LOCALIZATION NOTE(glodaFacetView.results.header.countLabel):
# This label is displayed above the list of result messages; it tells the user
#  how many messages we are displaying in the list out of the total number of
#  messages in the active set (the set of messages remaining after the
#  application of the facet constraints.)
# The goal of the various sub-parts here is to make a label along the lines of
#  "M of N".  Because there are two numbers, this is split into two parts,
#  'NMessages' for what in English is just the first number and 'ofN' for the
#  "of N" part.  We then use 'grouping' to decide how to combine the two. This
#  was suggested by Rimas Kudelis.
# LOCALIZATION NOTE(glodaFacetView.results.header.countLabel.NMessages):
#  The first part of the countLabel string (although you can change the order
#  in 'grouping').  This is pluralized using the mechanism described at
#  https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Localization_and_Plurals.  We replace
#  "#1" with the number of messages being shown in the result list.
glodaFacetView.results.header.countLabel.NMessages=#1;#1;#1
# LOCALIZATION NOTE(glodaFacetView.results.header.countLabel.ofN):
#  The second part of the countLabel string (although you can change the order
#  in 'grouping').  This is pluralized using the mechanism described at
#  https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Localization_and_Plurals.  We replace
#  "#1" with the total number of messagse in the active set.
glodaFacetView.results.header.countLabel.ofN=z #1;z #1;z #1
# LOCALIZATION NOTE(glodaFacetView.results.header.countLabel.grouping):
#  Combines the pluralized
#  "glodaFacetView.results.header.countLabel.NMessages" string (as #1) with
#  the pluralized "glodaFacetView.results.header.countLabel.ofN" (as #2)
#  to make a single label.
glodaFacetView.results.header.countLabel.grouping=#1 #2

# LOCALIZATION NOTE(glodaFacetView.results.message.recipientSeparator): This is
# the string in between the names of recipients (see
# glodaFacetView.results.message.andOthers for more information).  The \u0020
# character is a Unicode space character, which is needed as otherwise the
# trailing whitespace is trimmed before it gets to the code.
glodaFacetView.results.message.recipientSeparator=,\u0020

# LOCALIZATION NOTE(glodaFacetView.results.message.andOthers):
# When a message has too many recipients, we only show the first few and then
# display this label to express how many are not displayed.  So if a message
# has 5 recipients, we might only show the first 3, and then use this label
# to indicate that there are 2 that are not displayed.  This string can be
# pluralized; see https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Localization_and_Plurals
# for details on how to do that. Note that in English, we use the "serial
# comma", but other languages may not need a leading separator there.
