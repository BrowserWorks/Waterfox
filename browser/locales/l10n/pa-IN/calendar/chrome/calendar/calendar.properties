# Guessed Timezone errors and warnings.
# Testing note:
# * remove preference for calendar.timezone.default in userprofile/prefs.js
# * repeat
#   - set OS timezone to a city (windows: click right on clock in taskbar)

#   - observe guess in error console and verify whether guessed timezone city

# 'Warning: Operating system timezone "E. South America Standard Time"

# Testing notes:
# - Brasil DST change dates are set every year by decree, so likely out of sync.
# - Only appears on OSes from which timezone can be obtained
#   (windows; or TZ env var, /etc/localtime target path, or line in
#    /etc/timezone or /etc/sysconfig/clock contains ZoneInfo timezone id).
# - Windows: turning off "Automatically adjust clock for daylight saving time"
