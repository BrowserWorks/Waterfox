<ol>
  <li>Select the folder you want to move or copy.</li>
  <li>Do one of the following:
    <ul>
      <li>To move the folder under another folder within the same account, drag
        the folder over the name of the other folder. The folder you moved
        becomes a subfolder of the other folder.</li>
      <li>To copy the folder to another account, drag the folder over the name
        of another account.</li>
      <li>To copy the folder under another folder in another account, drag the

<p>[<a href="#organizing_your_messages">Return to beginning of section</a>]</p>

<h2 id="sharing_folders_with_other_users">Sharing Folders With Other Users
  (IMAP Only)</h2>

<p>Users with IMAP mail accounts can share mail folders with other users on the
  same network. Sharing folders allows several users to see and work with the
  same messages, similar to a newsgroup. To use shared folders, your IMAP mail
  server must support Access Control List (ACL) management. Check with your
  system administrator or help desk if you are not sure that shared folders
  are supported by your IMAP mail server.</p>

<p>To share a mail folder with other users on your network, or to view sharing
  information for a folder, begin from the Mail window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Within an IMAP account, select a folder that you want to share, or select
    a folder whose sharing privileges you want to view.

    <p>Folders listed under Local Folders, or folders listed under a POP mail
      account cannot be shared.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Open the Edit menu, and choose Folder Properties.</li>
  <li>Click the Sharing tab.</li>
  <li>Click Privileges. You may be prompted to enter your network user name and
    password.

    <p>The Privileges button is only available if the IMAP mail server allows
      you to set folder sharing privileges. If this button is not available,
      you can view the folder sharing privileges for this folder but cannot
      change them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Follow the instructions on the screen to add users and to set their
    folder access privileges.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Read privileges</strong>: Users can read messages and copy
        their contents, but they cannot modify or delete messages, or copy
        messages into the folder. Users can flag messages as read or unread.
        See <a href="#marking_or_flagging_messages">Marking or Flagging
        Messages</a> for instructions on flagging messages.</li>
      <li><strong>Read and Write privileges</strong>: In addition to Read
        privileges, users can modify and delete messages. Users can also copy
        or move messages into the folder.</li>
      <li><strong>Manage privileges</strong>: In addition to Read and Write
        privileges, users can add and remove users and change their folder
        permissions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Click OK to confirm your changes.</li>
  <li>Click OK to close the Folder Properties dialog box.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the list of folders for your mail account, a shared folder displays a
  distinctive folder icon to indicate that it is shared.</p>

<p>To send a message that tells others how they can subscribe to your shared
  folder, begin from the Mail window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the shared folder.</li>
  <li>Right-click to display a pop-up menu, and choose Copy Folder
    Location.</li>
  <li>Click Compose to display a Mail compose window.</li>
  <li>Click in the message body, open the Edit menu, and choose Paste.</li>
  <li>Address the message, type a subject, and type the message text. Tell
    message recipients that they can subscribe to the shared folder by clicking
    the link you pasted into the message.

    <p>Only message recipients who share the same network will be able to
      subscribe to your shared folder.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Click Send.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="subscribing_to_a_shared_folder">Subscribing to a Shared Folder</h3>

<p>Subscribing to a shared folder is similar to subscribing to a newsgroup. To
  subscribe to a shared folder, begin from the Mail window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the File menu and choose Subscribe. You see the Subscribe dialog
    box.</li>
  <li>If necessary, click the Account drop-down list to choose another IMAP
    mail account.</li>
  <li>Select the folder that you want to subscribe to.</li>
  <li>Click Subscribe or click in the Subscribe column next to the folder. You
    see a checkmark next to each folder to which you subscribe. Click
    Unsubscribe to cancel a selection.</li>
  <li>Click OK. The list of your subscribed folders appears in the Mail
    window.</li>
</ol>

<p>[<a href="#organizing_your_messages">Return to beginning of section</a>]</p>

<h2 id="tagging_messages">Tagging Messages</h2>

<p>You can apply tags to messages to help you organize and prioritize them.
  You can apply a standard color and tag text to messages, or you can create
  your own color and tag text to suit your needs.</p>

<p>One powerful way to use tags is to set up a message filter to
  automatically tag incoming messages from a specific sender. For example,
  you can set up a message filter so that incoming messages from your boss are
  tagged <q>Important</q> and appear in red. See
  <a href="#creating_message_filters">Creating Message Filters</a> for more
  information.</p>

<h3 id="applying_a_tag">Applying a Tag</h3>

<p>To apply a tag to a message, begin from the Mail window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the message you want to tag.</li>
  <li>Open the Message menu, and choose Tag.</li>
  <li>Choose the tag you want to apply from the list.</li>
</ol>

<p>The message summary row changes to the color of the tag with the topmost
  priority. To see the tag text, you must display the Tags column in the Mail
  window.</p>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: To quickly tag messages or remove a tag, select
  one or more messages and press one of the number keys 1-9 on your keyboard.
  Press 0 to remove all tags.</p>

<p>To display the Tags column, begin from the Mail window:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Click the Show/Hide Columns icon <img src="images/columns.png" alt=""/>
    and select Tags from the list.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Message tags apply on a per-account basis. For
  example, if you move or copy a tagged message to another mail account, the
  tags are not preserved. Similarly, if you forward a tagged message to
  another recipient, the tags are not preserved. For IMAP mail accounts, if
  your IMAP server supports user-defined keywords, message tags will persist
  when you log in to your mail account from a different location.</p>

<p>[<a href="#organizing_your_messages">Return to beginning of section</a>]</p>

<h3 id="customizing_tags">Customizing Tags</h3>

<p>You can customize tag colors and text and their order to suit your needs.</p>

<p>To customize tags, begin from the Mail window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the <span class="mac">&brandShortName;</span>
    <span class="noMac">Edit</span> menu and choose Preferences. You see the
    Preferences dialog box.</li>
  <li>Under the Mail &amp; Newsgroups category, click Tags. (If no
    subcategories are visible, double-click Mail &amp; Newsgroups to expand the
    list.)</li>
  <li>Edit the tag text, or replace it with your own tag text. The tag
    can be up to 32 characters long.</li>
  <li>To change the tag color, click the color block next to that tag and
    select a new color.</li>
  <li>Click the Move Up and Move Down buttons to reorder the tags. Tags at
    the top will have higher priority when coloring messages.</li>
  <li>Click OK.</li>
</ol>

<p>Your changes are immediately applied to all tagged messages in all your
  mail accounts.</p>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: To undo all customizations and restore just the
  default tags' text and colors, follow the steps above to display the tag
  settings, and click Restore Defaults.</p>

<p>[<a href="#organizing_your_messages">Return to beginning of section</a>]</p>

<h3 id="sorting_messages_by_tags">Sorting Messages by Tags</h3>

<p>To sort messages by tags, begin from the Mail window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>To display the Tags column if it is hidden, click the Show/Hide Columns
    icon <img src="images/columns.png" alt=""/> and select Tags from the
    list.</li>
  <li>Click the Tags column to sort messages by tags, and within each tag
    type, to sort messages by date.</li>
</ol>

<p>[<a href="#organizing_your_messages">Return to beginning of section</a>]</p>

<h3 id="removing_tags">Removing Tags</h3>

<p>To remove a message tag, begin from the Mail window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select one or more tagged messages.</li>
  <li>Open the Message menu, and choose Tag.</li>
  <li>Choose the tag you want to remove or <q>None</q> to remove all tags
    from this message.</li>
</ol>

<p>[<a href="#organizing_your_messages">Return to beginning of section</a>]</p>

<h2 id="marking_or_flagging_messages">Marking or Flagging Messages</h2>

<p>You might want to mark a message you&apos;ve read as unread if you later
  want to re-read the message or respond to it.</p>

<p>To mark a message as unread, begin from the Mail window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select a Mail or Newsgroup folder to display its messages.</li>
  <li>Click in the Read column of each message you want to mark as unread.
    Messages marked as unread display a <img src="images/mail_unread.png"
    alt=""/> symbol in the Read column. Messages marked as read display a
    <img src="images/mail_read.png" alt=""/> symbol in the Read column. If the
    Read column is not visible, click the Show/Hide Columns icon
    <img src="images/columns.png" alt=""/> and select Read from the list.</li>
</ol>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2"><img src="images/mail_read_column.png" alt=""/></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Read column</strong></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>You can flag messages that you later want to download for
  <a href="mailnews_offline.xhtml#downloading_selected_or_flagged_messages_for_offline_use">offline
  use</a>.</p>

<p>To flag messages, begin from the Mail window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select a Mail or Newsgroup folder to display its messages.</li>
  <li>Click in the Flag column of each message you want to download. A flag
    <img src="images/mail_flag.png" alt=""/> appears where you clicked to
    indicate that the message has been flagged. If the Flag column is not
    visible, click the Show/Hide Columns icon <img src="images/columns.png"
    alt=""/> and select Flag from the list.</li>

  </tr>
</table>

<p>[<a href="#organizing_your_messages">Return to beginning of section</a>]</p>

<h2 id="using_message_views">Using Message Views</h2>

<p>You can apply preset or custom message views to help you manage messages by
  filtering displayed messages.</p>

<p>To use a message view, open the View menu and choose Messages. Choose an
  option from the submenu.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>All</strong>: Choose this option to view all messages.</li>
  <li><strong>Unread</strong>: Choose this option to view only unread
    messages.</li>
  <li><strong>Tags</strong>: Choose a <a href="#tagging_messages">tag</a>
    to view tagged messages.</li>
  <li><strong>Custom Views</strong>: Choose a custom view. By default you have
    five preset views: <q>People I Know</q>, <q>Recent Mail</q>, <q>Last 5
    Days</q>, <q>Not Junk</q>, and <q>Has Attachments</q>.</li>
  <li><strong>Customize</strong>: Choose this option to view or modify
    settings for custom views or create your own custom view.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: You can quickly change the message view from the View

    <td colspan="2"><img src="images/mail_quicksearch.png" alt=""/></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="width: 80px;"></td>
    <td><strong>Quick mail search bar</strong></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3 id="creating_a_custom_view">Creating a Custom View</h3>

<p>You can create custom message views to only display messages matching
  certain criteria.</p>

<p>To change or create a custom message view:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the View menu, choose Messages, and then choose Customize.</li>
  <li>To create a new view, click New. To modify a view, select a view and
    click Edit.</li>
  <li>Type a name for the message view.</li>
  <li>Select the matching option you want Mail to use: <q><em>all</em> of the
    following</q> conditions (criteria) you choose, or <q><em>any</em> of the
    following</q>.</li>
  <li>Use the drop-down lists to choose the search criteria (for example,
    <q>Subject</q>, <q>Sender</q>, <q>contains</q>, <q>doesn&apos;t
    contain</q>) and then type the text or phrase you want to match.

    <p><strong>Tip</strong>: To search for messages that contain a header not
      listed in the first drop-down menu (for example, if you want to search
      for messages that include the header Resent-From), choose Customize and
      type the header you want to search for. &brandShortName; Mail &amp;
      Newsgroups adds your custom header to the drop-down list, so you can then
      choose it to search for matching entries. Make sure you enter the custom
      header correctly, since Mail will only find entries that exactly match
      what you type.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Click More to add criteria and Fewer to remove them.</li>
  <li>Click OK to confirm your settings.</li>
  <li>Click OK in the Customize Message Views dialog box. The selected view 
    setting applies automatically.</li>
</ol>

<p>[<a href="#organizing_your_messages">Return to beginning of section</a>]</p>

<h2 id="creating_message_filters">Creating Message Filters</h2>

<p>Message filters allow you to manage and organize your messages. You can
  create message filters that &brandShortName; Mail &amp; Newsgroups uses to
  automatically perform certain actions on incoming messages based on criteria
  you specify. For example, you can create a message filter that automatically
  moves incoming messages to a particular folder. Message filters operate on a
  per-account basis.</p>

<p>If you are not already viewing the Message Filters dialog box, begin from
  the Mail window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the Tools menu and choose Message Filters. You see the Message
    Filters dialog box.</li>
  <li>If you have multiple mail accounts, choose the one to which you want to
    apply the filter.</li>
  <li>Click New. You use the Filter Rules dialog box to specify the types of
    messages to act on, and the actions you want the filter to perform.</li>
  <li>Type a name for the filter.</li>
  <li>Select when you want the filter to be applied. This setting enables you
    to define some filters to be applied in an automatic way (when checking
    mail), on demand (manually run), or both. <q>After classification</q> means
    that junk and phishing controls will be run before applying the
    filter.</li>
  <li>Select the matching option you want Mail to use: <q><em>all</em> of the
    following</q> conditions (criteria) you choose, <q><em>any</em> of the
    following</q> conditions you choose, or <q><em>all messages</em></q>.</li>
  <li>Use the drop-down lists to choose the search criteria (for example,
    <q>Subject</q>, <q>Sender</q>, <q>contains</q>, <q>doesn&apos;t
    contain</q>) and then type the text or phrase you want to match.

    <p><strong>Tip</strong>: To search for messages that contain a header not
      listed in the first drop-down menu (for example, if you want to search
      for messages that include the header Resent-From), choose Customize and
      type the header you want to search for. &brandShortName; Mail &amp;
      Newsgroups adds your custom header to the drop-down list, so you can then
      choose it to search for matching entries. Make sure you enter the custom
      header correctly, since Mail will only find entries that exactly match
      what you type.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Click <q>+</q> to add criteria and <q>-</q> to remove them.</li>
  <li>Use the list to choose the action you want the filter to perform on the
    messages (for example, Move Message To). Use <q>+</q> and <q>-</q> to add
    or remove additional actions.

    <p><strong>Tip</strong>: To automatically tag incoming messages, choose
      <q>Tag Message</q> from the drop-down list.</p>

    <p><strong>Tip</strong>: Message filters are applied one after another. It
      could be that you don&apos;t want all filters to be run if one or more
      messages match some conditions. For instance, you may want to tag all
      messages from your boss&apos;s email address as <q>Important</q>, and
      you may want all messages containing the word <q>Memorandum</q> in their
      subject to be moved to a folder named <q>Pending Reads</q>, but you
      don&apos;t want any message from your boss to be moved to another folder,
      even if it contains <q>Memorandum</q> in the subject. So the first
      message filter you define should match your boss&apos;s email address,
      and would contain two actions: <q>Tag Message</q> as <q>Important</q> and
      <q>Stop Filter Execution</q>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>If you have chosen <q>Move</q> or <q>Copy</q> message to a folder, then
    select a destination folder in which to store the messages, or create a
    new folder.</li>
  <li>Click OK to confirm your settings.</li>
  <li>To run filters on existing messages in a folder, select the folder
    in the bottom dropdown list and click the <q>Run Now</q> button.</li>
  <li>Click OK in the Message Filters dialog box. The filter begins filtering
    incoming messages as soon as you click OK.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: You can also run message filters manually at any
  time. In the Mail window, choose Tools, and then select Run Filters on Folder
  to apply filters to the current folder, or Run Filters on Message to apply
  filters to the selected message (if any).</p>

<p>To manage your filters, begin from the Mail window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the Tools menu and choose Message Filters. You see the Message
    Filters dialog box.</li>
  <li>If you have multiple mail accounts, choose the one to which you want to
    apply the filter.</li>
  <li>Choose from the following:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>To turn a filter on or off</strong>: Click the checkbox to
        the right of the filter name to enable it, or click it again to turn it
        off.</li>
      <li><strong>To edit a filter</strong>: Select the filter name and click
        Edit (or double-click the filter name). Use the Filter Rules dialog box
        to make your changes.</li>
      <li><strong>To delete a filter</strong>: Select the filter name and click
        Delete.</li>
      <li><strong>To change the order in which filters are applied</strong>: In
        the filter list, click a filter&apos;s name, and click <q>Move Up</q>
        or <q>Move Down</q> to move it.

        <p><strong>Note</strong>: Filters are applied to each incoming message
          in the order you choose, until a filter action results in the message
          being deleted or moved from the Inbox folder.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Click OK when you are done managing your filters. If you created a new
    filter, it begins filtering incoming messages as soon as you click OK.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you delete a folder that you&apos;ve been using to
  store filtered messages, the filter will no longer work. Incoming messages
  that match the filter criteria will appear in your Inbox. If you rename or
  move the folder, the filter will automatically update to use the renamed or
  moved folder.</p>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: If you have existing messages that you want to move to
  another folder, use the Run Filters on Messages option in the Tools menu.</p>

<p>[<a href="#organizing_your_messages">Return to beginning of section</a>]</p>

<h3 id="filtering_messages_from_a_specific_sender">Filtering Messages From a
  Specific Sender</h3>

<p>You can quickly create a filter for messages from a particular sender. For
  example, if you want to automatically move all incoming messages from your
  child&apos;s teacher into a folder called <q>School</q>, you can quickly set
  up a filter to do this.</p>

<p>To create a filter for messages from a specific sender, begin from the Mail
  window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select a message from a specific sender.</li>
  <li>Open the Message menu and choose Create Filter From Message. Or, in the
    message header pane, right click the sender name and choose Create Filter
    From.</li>
  <li>You see the Filter Rules dialog box. Using the sender&apos;s email
    address, &brandShortName; prefills the filter matching criteria and the
    filter action (Move Message to). You can change or add new rules to the
    matching criteria.</li>
  <li>Choose a destination folder in which to store the incoming messages from
    the specified sender, or create a new folder. You can also choose other
    actions for this filter, or change the default one.</li>
  <li>Note that, if you leave the filter name empty, &brandShortName; will
    provide a name for it based on the first criterion.</li>
  <li>Click OK to confirm your settings. You see the
    <a href="#creating_message_filters">Message Filters</a> dialog box, where
    you can create, delete, or edit message filters.</li>
  <li>Click OK. The filter begins filtering incoming messages from the
    specified sender as soon as you click OK.</li>

<p>&brandShortName; Mail &amp; Newsgroups lets you quickly find text in a
  single message, search messages by subject or sender, or use a combination of
  criteria to perform a thorough search through all messages in a specific mail
  folder, newsgroup, or account.</p>

<p>To locate text in a single message, begin from the Mail window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the message, open the Edit menu, and choose Find in This
    Message.</li>
  <li>Type the text that you want to locate in the dialog box.</li>
  <li>Click Find to locate the first occurrence of the text.</li>
  <li>Continue clicking Find to locate additional occurrences, or click Cancel
    when you are done.</li>
  <li>Choose Find Again from the Edit menu to continue searching for the text
    throughout the rest of the message.</li>
</ol>

<p>To quickly search for messages in a selected folder by subject or sender,
  begin from the Mail window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>To the right of <q>Subject or Sender contains:</q>, type the subject text
    or sender name that you want to find. You can type only part of the subject
    or sender, or you can type the exact word or name that you want to find.

    <p>As soon as you stop typing, &brandShortName; Mail &amp; Newsgroups
      displays only those messages in the selected folder where the subject or
      sender contains the search text you entered.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Click Clear to erase the search text and show all messages in the
    selected folder.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="searching_for_specific_messages">Searching for Specific Messages</h3>

<p>You can search mail folders or newsgroups for specific messages. If you are
  not already viewing the Search Messages dialog box, begin from the Mail
  window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the Tools menu and choose Search Messages. You see the Search
    Messages dialog box.</li>
  <li>Next to <q>Search for messages in</q>, choose the account, newsgroup, or
    folder through which you want to search.</li>
  <li>Select <q>Search subfolders</q> to include all subfolders in the
    search.</li>
  <li>Next to <q>Perform search operations on</q>, select an option where to
    search for messages in newsgroups or IMAP accounts:
    <ul>
      <li>Choose <q>Local system</q> to use only the information stored locally
        for the search without any network activity. This mode includes all
        major message headers. You can&apos;t search the message body locally
        unless the account and its folders have been set up for
        <a href="mailnews_account_settings.xhtml#synchronization_and_storage">synchronization</a>.
      </li>
      <li>Choose <q>Remote server</q> to perform all searches on the server
        where the messages are located. This will allow you to also search for
        contents in message bodies which have not been synchronized.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: This menu will be disabled if it&apos;s not
      possible to search remotely on the server (e.g., for POP accounts).</p>
  </li>
  <li>Select which matching option Mail &amp; Newsgroups will use to search for
    messages that match all or at least one of the conditions (criteria) that
    you choose.</li>
  <li>Use the drop-down lists to indicate the search criteria (for example,
    <q>Subject</q> and <q>contains</q>) and then type the text or phrase that
    you want to match.

    <p><strong>Tip</strong>: To search for messages that contain a header not
      listed in the first drop-down menu (for example, if you want to search
      for messages that include the header Resent-From), choose Customize and
      type the header you want to search for. &brandShortName; Mail &amp;
      Newsgroups adds your custom header to the drop-down list, so you can then
      choose it to search for matching entries. Make sure you enter the custom
      header correctly, since Mail will only find entries that exactly match
      what you type.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Click More to add criteria and Fewer to remove them.</li>
  <li>Click Search to begin, or click Clear to reset your entries. The search
    results appear in lower part of the Search Messages dialog box.
    <ul>
      <li>To open a message so you can read it, select the message and click
        Open, or double-click the message.</li>
      <li>To sort the messages in a different order, click the column that you
        want to sort by.</li>
      <li>To move or copy a message in the Results area to another folder,
        select the message and then choose the destination folder from the File
        drop-down list. If the destination folder is within the same account,
        the message is moved to that folder. If the destination folder is
        within a different account, the message is copied to that folder.</li>
      <li>To delete a message in the Results area, select the message and then
        click Delete.</li>
      <li>To open the folder where the message is stored, select the message
        and click Open Message Folder.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<h1 id="controlling_junk_mail">Controlling Junk Mail</h1>

<p>This section describes how to use &brandShortName;&apos;s Junk Mail Controls
to filter unwanted mail, and how phishing detection works.</p>

</div>


<h2 id="using_junk_mail_controls">Using Junk Mail Controls</h2>

<p>&brandShortName;&apos;s Junk Mail Controls feature can evaluate your
  incoming messages and identify possible junk (or unsolicited) messages. The
  feature uses the Bayesian classification method. You first train
  &brandShortName; by showing it a bunch of mail that is junk, and a bunch of
  mail that is not. Then, you let it auto-classify new mail for you. If
  &brandShortName; makes any mistakes, you can correct them.</p>

<p>To use Junk Mail Controls:</p>

<ol>
  <li>First, train &brandShortName; to recognize Junk messages and Non-Junk
    messages. There are three ways to toggle junk status of the selected
    message(s):
    <ul>
      <li>Open the Message menu, select <q>Mark</q> and choose <q>As Junk</q>
        or <q>As Not Junk</q>.</li>
      <li>Click on the Junk toolbar button.</li>
      <li><img src="images/mail_junk_column.png" style="float:right" alt=""/>

        <p>Click to toggle the Junk Status column in the message list. (If you
          do not see it, click the right-most button (
          <img src="images/columns.png" alt=""/>) in the list header bar and
          select Junk Status from the pop-up menu.)</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>When you toggle junk status, a trash-can icon will appear or disappear
      in the Junk status column to indicate the junk status of the selected
      message.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>Open the Edit menu, and choose Mail &amp; Newsgroups Account Settings.
    You see the Mail &amp; Newsgroups Account Settings dialog box.</li>
  <li>Click the Junk Settings category for your mail account.</li>
  <li>Enable the feature and &brandShortName; will automatically classify
    incoming messages. (See
    <a href="#junk_controls_options">Junk Mail Controls Options</a>.
    Details on the other settings there can be found in the 
    <a href="mailnews_account_settings.xhtml#junk_settings">Junk Settings</a>
    preference panel description.)
  </li>
  <li>If you have trained it on virus mail, consider disabling the white
    listing (many mail viruses send bulk messages to people in the address book
    of the infected computer).</li>
  <li>Make sure to correct the Junk Mail Controls when it incorrectly labels
    messages either as junk or not junk.</li>
  <li>To analyze existing messages, select messages, open the Tools menu
    and choose <q>Run Junk Mail Controls</q>.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: &brandShortName; will only run Junk Mail Controls
  when the training database has information on non-Junk messages. If Junk Mail
  Controls do not work, select some messages and explicitly mark them as Not
  Junk.</p>

<h2 id="junk_controls_options">Junk Mail Controls Options</h2>

<p>To fine-tune how Junk Mail Controls work, use the 
  <a href="mailnews_preferences.xhtml#junk_and_suspect_preferences">Junk &amp;
  Suspect Mail preference panel</a> for account-independent settings and the
  account manager's <a href="mailnews_account_settings.xhtml#junk_settings">Junk
  Settings</a> for settings of a specific mail account.</p>

<p>[<a href="#controlling_junk_mail">Return to beginning of section</a>]</p>

<h2 id="junk_controls_and_filters">Junk Mail Controls and Filters</h2>

<p>Junk Mail Controls run after mail filters (unless you set the filter to run
  after classification, where <q>classification</q> includes junk and phishing
  scanning) and apply only to the Inbox folder and its sub-folders. Use this to
  your advantage, for example, you can filter mail you are sure not to be Junk
  to a special folder outside of Inbox so that the messages will not be
  classified as Junk (especially useful if you subscribe to newsletters or if
  you are on a moderated mailing list).</p>

<p>[<a href="#controlling_junk_mail">Return to beginning of section</a>]</p>

<h2 id="phishing_detection">Phishing Detection</h2>

<p>Phishing is a particularly common fraudulent business scheme in which
  a party creates counterfeit websites designed to trick recipients into
  divulging personal data such as credit card numbers, account usernames,
  passwords and social security numbers. Hijacking brand names of banks,
  e-retailers and credit card companies, phishers often convince
  recipients to respond.</p>

<p>In many cases, you&apos;ll receive a link to a phishing page via an email
  which claims to come from an official-looking address. You can also end up
  at these pages by following links that you find on the Web or in IM
  messages.</p>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: Since a forged <a href="glossary.xhtml#url">URL</a>
  can look very similar to a genuine one, it&apos;s safer to use a bookmark
  you&apos;ve created or to type the URL into the location bar by hand instead
  of following a link in an email message. Always consider the risk of a forged
  URL if you&apos;re asked to log in or provide private information on a
  website.</p>

<p>&brandShortName; Mail phishing detector is enabled by default. When it
  encounters a mail which seems to be scam, it will show a warning bar in the
  message window.</p>

<p>If you think that the email is a valid one, you can click on the <q>Not
  Scam</q> button, and the warning bar will disappear.</p>

<p>When a user clicks on a link in an email that appears to be a phishing URL,
  &brandShortName; will prompt the user with a dialog box before the website
  is opened.</p>

<p>This prompt will appear if either of the following is true: the host name of
  the actual URL is an <a href="glossary.xhtml#ip_address">IP address</a>, or
  the link text is a URL whose host name does not match the host name of the
  actual URL.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Phishing detection has a higher precedence than Junk
  Mail detection.</p>

  Phishing</a>.</p>
