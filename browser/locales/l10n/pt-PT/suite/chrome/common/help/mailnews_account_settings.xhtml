</ol>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Account Name</strong>: The name for this account.</li>
  <li>For any type of account but Blogs &amp; News Feeds:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Identity</strong>: Stores your name, email address, reply-to
        address (only if different from your email address), and organization
        (optional).</li>
      <li><strong>Signature text</strong>: If you want to attach a signature to
        all outgoing messages, type its text into this box. Check <strong>Use
        HTML</strong> to enable HTML code, e.g., &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt;
        (optional).</li>
      <li><strong>Attach the signature from a file instead</strong>: Lets you
        choose to attach the signature from a file (in text, HTML, or image
        format) rather than entering its text. Checking this option overrides
        any text entered into the signature box. Click Choose to locate the
        signature file (optional).

<h2 id="server_settings">Mail &amp; Newsgroups Account Settings - Server
  Settings</h2>

<p>&brandShortName; Mail &amp; Newsgroups can work with two types of mail
  servers: IMAP and POP. If you are not sure which server type your Internet
  service provider supports, ask your service provider. If your Internet
  service provider supports both, the following descriptions may help you
  choose which one to use.</p>

  section</a>]</p>

<h3 id="about_internet_message_access_protocol">About Internet Message Access
  Protocol (IMAP)</h3>

<p><strong>Advantages</strong>: Your messages and any changes to them stay on
  your server, saving local disk space. Also, you always have access to an
  updated mailbox, and you can get your mail from multiple locations.
  Performance on a modem is faster, since you initially download message
  headers only.</p>

<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong>: Not all ISPs support IMAP.</p>

<p>[<a href="#mail_and_newsgroups_account_settings">Return to beginning of
  section</a>]</p>

<h3 id="about_post_office_protocol">About Post Office Protocol (POP)</h3>

<p><strong>Advantages</strong>: Your messages are downloaded to your local
  computer all at once, but you can also specify whether to keep copies of the
  messages on the server and delete messages on the server when they are
  deleted locally. Most ISPs currently support POP.</p>

<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong>: If you use more than one computer, messages
  might reside on one or the other, but not both. POP doesn&apos;t work as well
  as IMAP over a slow link connection. Also, you can&apos;t access all mail
  folders from multiple locations.</p>

<p>Note that more recent POP servers have features that allow retrieving only
  the headers instead of the full message, like IMAP allows. Using these
  features allows performance with POP to be nearly as fast as with IMAP.</p>

<p>[<a href="#mail_and_newsgroups_account_settings">Return to beginning of

    Keep all messages that arrived within the given number of days.</li>
</ul>

<p>With the following settings you can further constrain the three options to
  delete messages automatically. This is especially useful in combination with
  the option to keep all messages.</p> 

<ul>
  <li><strong>Always keep flagged messages</strong>: Use this option to deny
    &brandShortName; to delete any messages you have flagged.</li>
  <li><strong>Remove bodies from message more than [__] days old</strong>:
    Select this option to retain all headers but to delete message bodies that
    are older than the number of days you specify here (news accounts only).
    Any option to delete the entire message based on age still applies.</li>
</ul>

<p>This policy can be overridden for an individual folder in the Folder
  Properties, Retention Policy tab.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If message synchronization is enabled (for IMAP), or
  messages are left on the server (for POP accounts), the settings apply to

<p>This section describes how to configure the Mail &amp; Newsgroup Account
  Settings that control mail message security. Before you do so, however, you
  must obtain one or more mail certificates. For details, see
  <a href="mail_sec_help.xhtml">Signing &amp; Encrypting Messages</a>.</p>

<p>If you are not already viewing the Security settings for your mail account,
  begin from the Mail window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the Edit menu and choose Mail &amp; Newsgroups Account
    Settings.</li>
  <li>Click Security under the name of the mail account whose security settings
    you want to configure.</li>
</ol>

    <li><a href="#digital_signing">Digital Signing</a></li>
    <li><a href="#encryption">Encryption</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h3 id="about_certificates">About Certificates</h3>

<p>The main purpose of the Security panel in Mail &amp; Newsgroup Account
  Settings is to select two certificates:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The email certificate you want to use for signing mail messages you send
    to other people.</li>
  <li>The email certificate you want other people to use when they encrypt
    messages they send to you.</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on the policies of the
  <a href="glossary.xhtml#certificate_authority">certificate authority (CA)</a>
  that issues your certificate(s), you can use one certificate for both
  purposes or two different certificates. Even if you use just one, you must
  specify it twice, once for digital signing and once for encryption.</p>

<p>The certificates you select here are included with every signed message you
  send. These certificates allow your recipients to verify your digital
  signature and to encrypt messages that they send to you.</p>

<h3 id="digital_signing">Digital Signing</h3>

<p>You use the Digital Signing area in the <a href="#security">Security
  panel</a> to specify how you want to sign your email messages:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Use this certificate to digitally sign messages you
    send</strong>: If this field is empty or if it displays the wrong
    certificate, click Select to choose from the certificates you have on
    file.</li>
  <li><strong>Digitally sign messages</strong>: Select this checkbox if you
    want to digitally sign all the messages you send. (A personal certificate
    must be specified below before you can select this checkbox.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Regardless of whether the <q>Digitally sign messages</q> checkbox is
  selected here, you can change your mind before you send an individual
  message.</p>

<p>To change the digital signature setting for a message you are writing in
  the Compose window, click the arrow below the Security icon near the top of
  the window and select or deselect <q>Digital Sign This Message</q>. For
  details, see
  <a href="mail_sec_help.xhtml#signing_and_encrypting_a_new_message">Signing
  &amp; Encrypting a New Message.</a></p>

<h3 id="encryption">Encryption</h3>

<p>You use the Encryption area in the <a href="#security">Security panel</a> to
  specify how you routinely want to use encryption when sending your
  messages:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Use this certificate to encrypt &amp; decrypt messages sent to
    you</strong>: If this field is empty or if it displays the wrong
    certificate, click Select to choose from the certificates you have on
    file.</li>
  <li><strong>Never</strong>: Select this option if you never want to use
    encryption, or only occasionally.</li>
  <li><strong>Required</strong>: Select this option if you always want to use
    encryption. If you don&apos;t have all the necessary certificates, the
    message won&apos;t be sent unless you explicitly turn off encryption for
    that message only.</li>
</ul>

<p>Regardless of which encryption option you select, you can change your mind
  before you send an individual message.</p>

<p>To change the encryption setting for a message you are writing in the
  Compose window, click the arrow below the Security icon near the top of the
  window and choose the encryption setting you want. For details, see
  <a href="mail_sec_help.xhtml#signing_and_encrypting_a_new_message">Signing

    configuration. This will show up as first part in the server list.</li>
  <li><strong>Server name</strong>: The SMTP server that will deliver your
    outgoing mail. To use a different SMTP server, change this field.</li>
  <li><strong>Port</strong>: The port on which the SMTP server will be
    connected. By default it holds the standard port for the specified
    encryption. Change it if the mail server is listening for connections
    on a non-standard port.</li>
  <li><strong>Use name and password</strong>: If your SMTP server requires
    authentication to send mail, select this option and enter your user name.
    The first time you send mail, you will be prompted for your password. At
    that time you can instruct &brandShortName; to save your password for
    future sessions.</li>
  <li><strong>Use secure authentication</strong>: Choose this setting if you
    want to use secure mechanisms for logging in like CRAM-MD5. If you are
    unsure if your service supports this, contact your service provider or
    system administrator.</li>
  <li><strong>Use secure connection</strong>: There are two methods for
    establishing a <a href="glossary.xhtml#secure_connection">secure
    connection</a> to your outgoing server. Pick the one your server supports
    (if you make a choice for which your server is not configured, you will
    get an error message when sending mail).
    <ul>
      <li><strong>STARTTLS, if available</strong>: &brandShortName; will try to
        negotiate encryption using the
        <a href="glossary.xhtml#starttls">STARTTLS</a> method. If the server
        doesn&apos;t support it, an unencrypted connection is used.</li>
      <li><strong>STARTTLS</strong>: Require an encrypted connection, use the
        <a href="glossary.xhtml#starttls">STARTTLS</a> method. This mechanism
        will usually run on the standard SMTP port 25.</li>
      <li><strong>SSL/TLS</strong>: Require an encrypted connection, use the
        SMTP-over-SSL (also known as SMTPS) method. The default port for this
        is 465.</li>
