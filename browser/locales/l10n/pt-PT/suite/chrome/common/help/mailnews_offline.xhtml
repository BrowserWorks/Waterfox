  Wizard</h2>

<p>To set up a mail, newsgroup or blogs &amp; news feeds account, first open
  the Window menu and choose Mail &amp; Newsgroups. If you haven&apos;t
  already set up an account, the Account Wizard appears automatically, enabling
  you to set up an account.</p>

<p>The Account Wizard guides you through the process of creating a new account.
  If you don&apos;t know a setting, click Cancel and ask your Internet service
  provider (ISP) or help desk.</p>

<p>If an account already exists, the Account Wizard doesn&apos;t appear
  automatically when the Mail window opens. Instead, after opening the Mail
  window, open the File menu and choose New, then Account. For more details,
  see <a href="#setting_up_additional_mail_and_news_accounts">Setting Up

        the checkbox is unchecked, mail will be stored in its own
        directory.</li>
      <li>Enter the name of your outgoing mail server (SMTP).

        <p><strong>Note</strong>: You need to specify only one outgoing mail
          server (SMTP), even if you have several mail accounts. The name of
          your <a href="glossary.xhtml#smtp">SMTP</a> host may not have been
          explicitly listed in the account setup information provided to you.
          For example, your SMTP host may be the same as your POP or IMAP host.
          If in doubt, contact your ISP or system administrator.</p>

    see the Mail &amp; Newsgroups Account Settings dialog box.</li>
  <li>Click the account name in the left-hand side of the Account Settings
    dialog box. You see information about the account, such as your email
    address and signature, in the right side of the dialog box.</li>
  <li>Click any of these items beneath the name of an account to see the
    corresponding settings:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Server Settings</strong>: The settings available depend on
        the type of server (IMAP, POP, or newsgroup server). For more
        information, see
        <a href="mailnews_account_settings.xhtml#server_settings">Mail &amp;
        Newsgroups Account Settings - Server Settings</a>.

        <p><strong>Important</strong>: If you need to change the server type
          (for example, from POP to IMAP) you must first remove the existing
          account. Next, you must exit &brandShortName; and restart it. You can
          then reopen the Mail &amp; Newsgroups Account Settings dialog box and
          recreate an account with the new server type by clicking Add
          Account.</p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Copies &amp; Folders</strong>: These settings determine
        whether to send automatic messages (blind carbon copies) and where you
        want to store copies of outgoing messages, message drafts, and message
        templates. For more information, see
        <a href="mailnews_account_settings.xhtml#copies_and_folders">Mail
        &amp; Newsgroups Account Settings - Copies &amp; Folders</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Composition &amp; Addressing</strong>: These settings allow
        you to choose your default format and quoting behavior when composing a
        message. You can also override the global directory server settings
        specified for all address books in the Preferences dialog box. For more

        &amp; Storage Settings (News)</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Disk Space (POP and blogs &amp; news feeds accounts
        only)</strong>: This setting helps you manage the amount of disk
        space that downloaded messages take up on your hard disk. For more
        information, see
        <a href="mailnews_account_settings.xhtml#disk_space_settings_pop">Disk

        digitally sign and encrypt mail messages that you send. Digital
        signatures allow you to identify yourself reliably to others in
        mail messages that you send. Encryption helps ensure that your
        messages remain private while they are in transit over the
        Internet. For more information, see

<h2 id="getting_new_messages">Getting New Messages</h2>

<p>For an IMAP account, you can retrieve new messages automatically and display
  them in the Inbox by opening Mail &amp; Newsgroups and selecting the Inbox
  for the IMAP account.</p>

<p>For a POP account, you must select the Inbox and click Get Msgs to retrieve
  your messages. By default, messages from your POP account are downloaded in
  full and deleted from the POP server when you retrieve them. You can
  <a href="mailnews_account_settings.xhtml#pop_server_settings">change your POP
  server settings</a> to retrieve just the headers and/or store a copy of
  messages on the server in addition to downloading them to your computer.</p>
  
<p>For news accounts, expanding the account newsgroups list will automatically
  check for new items, as it will by just selecting one of the newsgroups.
  While reading a newsgroup, you can force checking for new items by clicking
  Get Msgs.</p>

<p>For blogs &amp; feeds accounts, the first time you expand the account, it
  will be checked for new items. Besides that, you can force checking for new
  items at any time by clicking Get Msgs.</p>

<p>You can also set up Mail &amp; Newsgroups to get new messages at startup and
  to check for new messages at timed intervals.</p>

<p>To set up a mail account to automatically check for new messages, begin from
  the Mail window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the Edit menu and choose Mail &amp; Newsgroups Account Settings. You
    see the Mail &amp; Newsgroups Account Settings dialog box.</li>
  <li>If you have multiple accounts, select an account and click the Server
    Settings category for that account.</li>
  <li>Select one or both of the following options in the Server Settings
    section:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Check for new mail at startup</strong>: Select this checkbox
        if you want to check this account automatically for new messages
        whenever you start Mail &amp; Newsgroups. For POP accounts, Mail &amp;
        Newsgroups checks for new mail, but doesn&apos;t download new messages
        until you click Get Msgs or unless you choose <q>Automatically download
        any new messages</q>.</li>
      <li><strong>Check for new messages every [__] minutes</strong>: Select
        this checkbox if you want to specify the number of minutes between mail
        checks. You can also check for new messages at any time by clicking Get
        Msgs in the Mail window.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Click OK. Your settings take effect the next time you start
    &brandShortName; Mail &amp; Newsgroups.</li>
</ol>

<p>To set up &brandShortName; Mail &amp; Newsgroups to play a sound or display
  an alert when new mail arrives, see <a
  href="mailnews_preferences.xhtml#notifications">Mail &amp; Newsgroups
  Preferences - Notifications</a>.</p>

<p>You can always retrieve messages manually at any time. To get new messages
  for the selected account or newsgroup, do one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Click Get Msgs on the Mail toolbar.</li>
  <li>Open the File menu (in the Mail window) and choose Get New Messages.</li>
</ul>

<p>To get new messages for all your mail accounts, begin from the Mail
  window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click the triangle on the Get Msgs button in the Mail toolbar.</li>
  <li>Choose Get All New Messages. &brandShortName; Mail &amp; Newsgroups
    retrieves new messages for all your mail accounts.

    <p>If you are not currently logged into one of your mail accounts, Mail
      &amp; Newsgroups first prompts you to enter your user name and password
      before retrieving new messages for that account. (If you have already
      stored your user name and password using the Password Manager, Mail &amp;
      Newsgroups doesn&apos;t prompt you for this information.)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: You can also open the File menu (in the Mail window)
  and choose <q>Get New Messages for</q>.</p>

<p>To get new messages for a specific mail account, begin from the Mail
  window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click the triangle on the Get Msgs button on the Mail toolbar.</li>
  <li>Choose the account for which you want to retrieve mail.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Mail &amp; Newsgroups prompts you for your password
  the first time you retrieve messages for an account. You can choose to have
  Mail &amp; Newsgroups store your password in the Password Manager at that
  time.</p>

<p>Password Manager can save all your user names and passwords on your own
  computer and enter them for you automatically. For more information, see

  this mode. If <q>Preserve threading when sorting messages</q> is not selected,
  &brandShortName; automatically displays the messages unthreaded when you sort
  them by clicking on a column header.</p>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: To help you identify unread messages in a collapsed
  thread where you&apos;ve read the parent message, &brandShortName; Mail &amp;
  Newsgroups underlines the parent message.</p>

  Messages</h2>

<p>You can address, compose, reply to, or send a new message by doing one of
  the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In any &brandShortName; window, open the File menu and choose New, then
    Message.</li>
  <li>Click Compose on the Mail toolbar.</li>
  <li>While displaying a message, click Reply, Forward, or Reply All on the
    Mail toolbar.</li>
  <li>From the Address Book window, select an address and click Compose on the
    Address Book.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: Use the Mail &amp; Newsgroups Account Settings - 
  <a href="mailnews_account_settings.xhtml#addressing">Composition &amp;
  Addressing</a> dialog box to specify the HTML text editor to use for
  composing messages sent from this account. (You can specify a different
  editor for each of your accounts.) See <a
  href="#changing_the_settings_for_an_account">Changing the Settings for an
  Account</a> for more information.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: It is generally not possible to compose messages for
  them to be published in blogs &amp; news feeds accounts. If you want to
  publish posts in a blog (and you have the appropiate rights to do it), you
  will need to use the mechanisms provided by the specific blog system. In some
  cases, this can even include sending a mail message to a specific address.</p>

<p>Composing messages in HTML format allows you to use different fonts, text
  styles (such as bold or italic) and text colors, tables, numbered or bulleted
  lists, and pictures in your messages. However, some recipients may only be
  able to read messages composed in plain text format. If you want to use the
  plain-text editor occasionally, you can hold down the Shift key while
  clicking the Compose or the Reply button to use the plain-text editor on an
  as-needed basis.</p>

<p>[<a href="#sending_messages">Return to beginning of section</a>]</p>

<h2 id="using_the_message_composition_window">Using the Message Composition
  Window</h2>

<p>Use the Compose window to address, compose, and send mail and newsgroup
  messages. First specify whether you want to compose messages in plain text or
  HTML by default in the <a
  href="mailnews_account_settings.xhtml#addressing">Composition &amp;
  Addressing</a> Preferences panel (open the Edit menu and choose Mail &amp;
  Newsgroups Account Settings).</p>

<p>To view the Compose window, click the Compose button on the Mail
  toolbar.</p>

<p>The Compose window contains the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mail Toolbar

    <p>You can click the following buttons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Send</strong>: To send a completed message.</li>
      <li><strong>Address</strong>: To search for names in your address
        books.</li>
      <li><strong>Attach</strong>: To attach a file to a message. See
        <a href="#using_attachments">Using Attachments</a> for more
        information.</li>
      <li><strong>Spell</strong>: To check the spelling of your message
        text.</li>
      <li><strong>Security</strong>: To display information about whether
        your message will be sent encrypted or digitally signed (or
        both).</li>
      <li><strong>Save</strong>: To save the message as a draft.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Addressing area: Where you enter the email addresses of recipients.</li>
  <li>Attachments area: When you attach files to a message (by clicking in this
    area or by clicking the Attach button), the filenames will be listed in the
    Attachments area to the right of the Addressing area.</li>
  <li>Message body area: Where you type the contents of your message.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you&apos;ve chosen to compose messages using the HTML editor, you see an
  additional toolbar with text formatting buttons similar to those in
  &brandShortName; Composer.</p>

<p>For help using the HTML editor, see
  <a href="composer_help.xhtml#formatting_your_web_pages">Formatting Your Web
  Pages</a>.</p>

<p>[<a href="#sending_messages">Return to beginning of section</a>]</p>

<h2 id="addressing_a_message">Addressing a Message</h2>

<p>To address a mail message:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Type the name in the addressing area.

    <p>If you have <a
      href="mailnews_preferences.xhtml#address_autocompletion">address
      autocompletion</a> enabled (it&apos;s enabled by default), type the first
      few letters of the recipient&apos;s name and wait for Mail &amp;
      Newsgroups to complete the address. (Or you can type part of the name and
      immediately press <kbd class="mac">Return</kbd><kbd
      class="noMac">Enter</kbd> to have Mail &amp; Newsgroups try to complete
      the address.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>If multiple addresses are displayed, select an address and press
    <kbd class="mac">Return</kbd><kbd class="noMac">Enter</kbd>.

    <p><strong>Note</strong>: Use a comma to separate multiple addresses on the
      same line. Do not use a comma to separate first or last names. For
      example, multiple entries might be:</p>

    <p><tt>user1@netscape.net,user2@netscape.net</tt></p>
  </li>
  <li>If you want this message to be sent from a different account, click the
    <q>From</q> field to select the account you want. See
    <a href="#changing_the_account_from_which_a_message_is_sent">Changing the
    Account From Which a Message is Sent</a> for more information.</li>
  <li>If necessary, click <q>To</q> to choose a different recipient type:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>To</strong>: For primary recipients of your message.</li>
      <li><strong>Cc</strong>: For secondary recipients (carbon copy).</li>
      <li><strong>Bcc</strong>: For secondary recipients not identified to the
        other recipients, including those in the cc list (blind carbon
        copy).</li>
      <li><strong>Reply-To</strong>: For recipients to reply to a different
        email address other than the one the message is sent from.</li>
      <li><strong>Newsgroup</strong>: For posting to a newsgroup.</li>
      <li><strong>Followup-To</strong>: For redirecting a newsgroup posting, so
        that subsequent replies go directly to the redirected newsgroup instead
        of the original newsgroup.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: You can quickly address a message by clicking the
  email address contained in a message you&apos;re reading, and then selecting
  Compose Mail To from the pop-up menu.</p>

<p id="changing_the_account_from_which_a_message_is_sent"><strong>Changing the
  Account From Which a Message is Sent</strong></p>

<p>If you have multiple mail accounts, the account listed in the From field is
  based on the account (or server) you selected when you choose to create a new
  message. However, &brandShortName; Mail &amp; Newsgroups also allows you to
  change the account a message is sent from while you&apos;re composing a
  message. Click the From field to view a list of your accounts and then select
  the account you want. A copy of the message is saved in the Sent folder of
  the account where you sent the message from.</p>

<p><strong>About Address Autocompletion</strong></p>

<p>Address autocompletion allows you to address mail easily from the Compose
  window without having to search for names or type complete names. Mail &amp;
  Newsgroups automatically checks your address books and an
  <a href="glossary.xhtml#ldap">LDAP</a> directory server (if available) and
  completes the name if it finds a unique match. It also prevents mistakes by
  showing all possible choices with additional information if it finds multiple
  matches. Address autocompletion is enabled by default.</p>

<p>If you don&apos;t want to use an address that Mail &amp; Newsgroups
  provides, press Backspace or Delete to remove characters and then enter an
  alternate address.</p>

<p>To disable address autocompletion:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the <span class="mac">&brandShortName;</span>
    <span class="noMac">Edit</span> menu and choose Preferences.</li>
  <li>Under the Mail &amp; Newsgroups category, click Addressing. (If no
    subcategories are visible, double-click Mail &amp; Newsgroups to expand
    the list).</li>
  <li>In the Address Autocompletion section, deselect <q>Local Address
    Books</q> and <q>Directory Server</q>.</li>
  <li>Click OK.</li>
</ol>

<p>[<a href="#sending_messages">Return to beginning of section</a>]</p>

<h2 id="selecting_message_sending_options">Selecting Message Sending
  Options</h2>

<p>While you&apos;re composing a message, you can select these additional
  message sending options from the Options menu:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Select Addresses</strong>: The Select Addresses option lets you
    choose the recipient&apos;s email address from your Address Books or a
    remote directory. To look up an address in an address book or directory,
    enter the first few letters of the recipient&apos;s first or last name to
    start the search. Select an address and then click To:, Cc:, or Bcc: to
    address your message.</li>
  <li><strong>Check Spelling</strong>: Checks the spelling of the message text
    before you send it. You can also click Spell.</li>
  <li><strong>Spellcheck As You Type</strong>: Choose this option to have the
    spelling of the message text checked as you type.</li>
  <li><strong>Quote Message</strong>: Choose this option to have the selection
    of the message text shown as quoted text.</li>
  <li><strong>Return Receipt</strong>: Choose this option to request a
    confirmation message when the recipient displays (opens) the message. Keep
    in mind that the recipient may choose not to send you a return receipt.
    This option lets you enable or disable return receipt requests on a
    per-message basis. To automatically request return receipts for all
    messages you send, use the return receipts preferences. See
    <a href="mailnews_preferences.xhtml#return_receipts_preferences">Mail &amp;
    Newsgroups Preferences - Return Receipts</a> for more information.</li>
  <li><strong>Format</strong>: Send the message as plain text, or HTML
    (formatted), or both. If you choose <q>Auto-Detect</q>, Mail &amp;
    Newsgroups prompts you for the format to use if it&apos;s unknown whether
    the recipient&apos;s mail program can display an HTML message. The format
    you choose here overrides the send format you specified using the
    Preferences command on the <span class="mac">&brandShortName;</span>
    <span class="noMac">Edit</span> menu.</li>
  <li><strong>Priority</strong>: Choose a priority to indicate whether the
    message has lowest, low, normal, high, or highest priority.</li>
  <li><strong>Character Encoding</strong>: Choose a character encoding used for
    this message.</li>
  <li><strong>Send a Copy To</strong>: Choose this if you want to file an
    additional copy of the sent message in a different folder than your default
    Sent folder. Then select the folder you want.</li>
  <li><strong>Security</strong>: Choose this to change the default security
    options for this message.</li>
</ul>

<p>An additional message formatting option is available from the Edit menu:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Rewrap</strong>: If you are composing a message using the
    plain-text editor, you can use the Rewrap command to rewrap long lines of
    quoted text to fit the Compose window. This command rewraps selected quoted
    text to the number of characters specified by the
    <a href="mailnews_preferences.xhtml#composition">Composition</a>
    preferences. This command is primarily useful when you are replying to a
    message where the original message is quoted in your reply, and the original
    message contains long lines.

    <p>You use the Mail &amp; Newsgroups Account Settings command on the Edit
      menu to specify that you want to use the plain-text editor for composing
      messages. Select the Composition &amp; Addressing panel of the account
      and uncheck <q>Compose messages in HTML format</q> to use the plain-text
      editor for all messages. If you only want to use the plain-text editor
      occasionally, you can hold down the Shift key while clicking the Compose
      or the Reply button to use the plain-text editor on an as-needed
      basis.</p>

    Addressing</a> category for that account.</li>
  <li>Select <q>Automatically quote the original message when
    replying</q>.</li>
  <li>Specify where in the message to place your reply. <q>Start my reply below
    the quote</q> is the default.</li>
  <li>If you have decided to <a
    href="mailnews_account_settings.xhtml#account_settings">attach a
    signature</a> to every outgoing message and selected to start your reply
    above the quote here, you can additionally configure where your signature
    is placed:

  <li>For forwarding messages, choose Inline (in the message body) or As
    Attachment.

    <p><strong>Note</strong>: If you have created a signature and forward
      inline, its placement depends on the respective reply setting. You can
      optionally <a href="mailnews_account_settings.xhtml#addressing">omit the
      signature</a> when forwarding a message.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Click OK.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: To override the default for forwarding a message,
  select the message, open the Message menu, and choose Forward As, then
  choose Inline or Attachment.</p>

<p>[<a href="#sending_messages">Return to beginning of section</a>]</p>

<h2 id="confirming_that_your_message_was_opened">Confirming That Your Message
  Was Opened</h2>

<p>You can use return receipts to notify you when a recipient has displayed
  (opened) your message. The recipient must be using a mail program that
  supports the Message Disposition Notification (MDN) standard. Keep in mind
  that the recipient may choose not to send you a return receipt, even if
  you&apos;ve requested one. Messages you send to a newsgroup address will not
  include a return receipt request, since news servers don&apos;t support this
  feature.</p>

<p>To request return receipts for all messages you send, you can use the global
  <a href="mailnews_preferences.xhtml#return_receipts_preferences">Return
  Receipt</a> preferences to specify how to manage requests you receive for
  return receipts. You can override these global preferences for individual
  accounts.</p>

<p>To request a return receipt on a per-message basis:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From a Mail Compose window, open the Options menu, and choose Return
    Receipt.</li>
</ul>

<p>To automatically request return receipts when sending messages from each of
  your mail accounts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the <span class="mac">&brandShortName;</span>

<h2 id="saving_and_editing_a_message_draft">Saving and Editing a Message
  Draft</h2>

<p>To save a mail message as a draft so you can complete it later:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In the Compose window, click Save, or open the File menu and choose Save
    as Draft. By default, the message is saved in the Drafts folder for the
    current account.

    <p><strong>Note</strong>: Your mail message will stay open after you save

      folder.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: You can also double-click the message to open it for
  editing. This is especially useful if the message pane is closed.</p>

  Mail compose window.</p>

<p>To save a message to use as a template:</p>

<ol>
  <li>In the Mail window, click Compose to create a new message and then set
    the default font, text size, text color, background color, and any other

    created the message template.</li>
  <li>Double-click the message template to open it.</li>
  <li>Edit the message, then save it (to put it in the Drafts folder) or send
    it.

    <p><strong>Note</strong>: Sending the message does not remove the template
      from the Templates folder. The template is preserved for future use.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>To delete one or more unwanted message templates, begin from the Mail
  window:</p>

<ol>

<p>HTML messages can include formatted text, links, images, and
  tables&mdash;just like a web page. However, some recipients may not be able
  to receive HTML messages. &brandShortName; Mail &amp; Newsgroups allows you
  to compose mail and newsgroup messages using either the HTML (rich-text)
  formatting editor or the plain-text editor for each mail account you have.
  In addition, you can choose whether your addressees should receive HTML or
  plain-text messages by default, and how Mail &amp; Newsgroups should handle
  messages when it&apos;s not known if an addressee can receive HTML-formatted
  mail.</p>

<p>To specify whether to use the HTML editor as the default for composing
  messages, begin from the Mail window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the Edit menu and choose Mail &amp; Newsgroups Account Settings. You
    see the Mail &amp; Newsgroups Account Settings dialog box.</li>
  <li>Select the mail or newsgroup account you want to use.</li>
  <li>Go to the Composition &amp; Addressing panel and select <q>Compose
    messages in HTML format</q>. You see the Formatting toolbar in the Compose
    window. Leave this box unchecked to use the plain-text editor for this

<h2 id="choosing_html_mail_sending_options">Choosing HTML Mail Sending
  Options</h2>

<p>By default, Mail &amp; Newsgroups prompts you before sending HTML messages
  when it&apos;s not known whether the recipient&apos;s mail program can
  display HTML-formatted messages.</p>

<p>To choose sending-format options for mail messages, begin from the Mail
  window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the <span class="mac">&brandShortName;</span>
    <span class="noMac">Edit</span> menu and choose Preferences.</li>
  <li>Under the Mail &amp; Newsgroups category, click
    <a href="mailnews_preferences.xhtml#send_format">Send Format</a>. (If no
    subcategories are visible, double-click Mail &amp; Newsgroups to expand the
    list).

    <p><strong>Note</strong>: This preference applies only to mail messages,
      not to newsgroup messages.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Select the option you want and then click OK.</li>
</ol>

<p>If while composing a message you realize that one or more recipients may not
  be able to receive HTML-formatted mail, you can easily convert the message to
  a different format when you click Send:</p>

<ol>
  <li>In the Compose window, open the Options menu and choose Format.</li>
  <li>Select the format you want to use for sending the message from the
    submenu:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Auto Detect</strong>: Mail &amp; Newsgroups chooses the
        appropriate format for the message text. If it can&apos;t determine the
        format, it asks you to choose a format.</li>
      <li><strong>Plain Text Only</strong>: The message may not display
        formatting such as bold text, but all mail programs will be able to
        display the message.</li>
      <li><strong>Rich Text (HTML) Only</strong>: Some mail programs may have
        trouble displaying an HTML-formatted message. Choose this option only
        if you are sure the recipient&apos;s mail program can display
        HTML-formatted mail.</li>
      <li><strong>Plain and Rich (HTML) Text</strong>: This uses more disk
        space, but may be the best choice if you are not sure whether the
        recipient&apos;s mail program can display HTML-formatted mail.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<p>If you receive a mail attachment that consists of a file type that
  &brandShortName; can display (such as graphic files and HTML files), you see
  the attachment displayed inline (in the body of the message). For other file
  types, Mail &amp; Newsgroups lets you open the attachment using another
  application, or you can save the attachment on your hard disk.</p>

<p>To open the attachment, make sure you have a program on your computer that
  can open files of the same type as the attachment&apos;s file format. For
  example, if you want to open a .DOC file, make sure you have a program on
  your computer that can open .DOC files.</p>

<p>To open an attachment:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Double-click the attachment you want (if there is more than one).</li>
  <li>In the Downloading dialog box, choose what you want &brandShortName; to
    do with the attachment:
    <ul>
      <li>If &brandShortName; finds an application on your hard disk that can
        open the attachment, you can open the attachment using that
        application. Click <q>Choose</q> to use a different application to open
        the attachment.</li>
      <li>If &brandShortName; can&apos;t find an application on your hard disk

        won&apos;t be able to open the  attachment, but at least you can save
        it on your hard disk until you can install an application that can open
        it.</li>
      <li>Click <q>Advanced</q> to add a new file type to the list of helper

<h2 id="about_address_books">About Address Books</h2>

<p>Address books store email addresses and contact information for people you
  typically send mail to, such as colleagues, friends, and family.
  &brandShortName; Mail &amp; Newsgroups provides you with two address books:
  the Personal Address Book and the Collected Addresses&mdash;and you can
  create additional address books as well. You can also import address books
  from other mail programs and previous versions of &brandShortName;. The
  contents of these address books are stored locally on your hard disk.</p>

<p>Your address book may also list email addresses from an LDAP directory,
  which is located on an LDAP directory server. The directory server stores
  email addresses of people that are not included in your locally-stored
  address books. The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is an
  industry-standard method for accessing Internet or intranet directory
  services such as corporate address books.</p>

<h4>Personal Address Book</h4>

<p>Use the Personal Address Book to add specific names of your choice. You can
  create mailing lists and edit individual address entries.</p>

<h4>Collected Addresses</h4>

<p>By default, the Collected Addresses automatically collects the email
  addresses contained in outgoing mail messages. Addresses from outgoing
  messages are stored in the Collected Addresses as soon as you click Send.</p>

<h4>LDAP Directory (if available)</h4>

<p>An LDAP directory (also known as an address lookup service) stores email
  addresses of recipients who are not in your locally-stored address books.
  LDAP directories offer you access to large, centrally maintained databases
  of email addresses, which is especially useful with
  <a href="mailnews_preferences.xhtml#address_autocompletion">address
  autocompletion</a>.</p>

<p>Automatic address collection is enabled by default. To change automatic
  address collection settings, begin in the Mail window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the <span class="mac">&brandShortName;</span>
    <span class="noMac">Edit</span> menu and choose Preferences.</li>
  <li>Under the Mail &amp; Newsgroups category, click Addressing. (If no
    subcategories are visible, double-click Mail &amp; Newsgroups to expand the
    list.)</li>
  <li>Under Email Address Collection, select <q>Add email addresses to my</q>
    and choose whether you want:
    <ul>
      <li>Personal Address Book.</li>
      <li>Collected Addresses.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Click OK.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Opening the Address Book Window</h4>

          <li>Nickname (a shortcut or alias for the real name).</li>
          <li>Email address (primary and additional address).</li>
          <li>Prefers to receive messages formatted as: If you know this
            recipient can read HTML-formatted messages (such as messages that
            include links, images, or tables), choose HTML. If this recipient
            can only read messages sent as plain text (no formatting), then
            choose Plain Text. If you don&apos;t know or are not sure, choose
            Unknown. If you choose Unknown, &brandShortName; Mail &amp;
            Newsgroups determines the sending format based on the Mail &amp;

            Mail &amp; Newsgroups still can&apos;t determine the correct
            format, Mail &amp; Newsgroups will prompt you to choose a sending
            format when you send the message.</li>
          <li>Allow remote images in HTML mail: If you want to allow this

<h2 id="importing_address_books">Importing Address Books</h2>

<p>If you have a &brandShortName; address book from another user profile or
  computer, or if you have an address book from another mail program, you can
  import its entries into the Address Book window as a new address book. Keep
  in mind that when you upgrade a user profile from an earlier version of
  &brandShortName;, your address books are automatically included, so
  there&apos;s no need to import them.</p>

<p>You can import address books from Netscape 6, Netscape 7, Eudora, Outlook,
  Outlook Express, or text files (LDIF, tab-delimited (.tab), comma-separated
  (.csv), or text (.txt) formats). When you import an address book, Mail &amp;
  Newsgroups creates a new address book with the imported entries.</p>

<p>You can also <a href="#importing_mail_from_other_programs">import mail
  messages and settings</a> from Communicator, Eudora, Outlook, and Outlook
  Express.</p>

<h2 id="sharing_folders_with_other_users">Sharing Folders With Other Users
  (IMAP Only)</h2>

<p>Users with IMAP mail accounts can share mail folders with other users on the
  same network. Sharing folders allows several users to see and work with the
  same messages, similar to a newsgroup. To use shared folders, your IMAP mail
  server must support Access Control List (ACL) management. Check with your
  system administrator or help desk if you are not sure that shared folders
  are supported by your IMAP mail server.</p>

<p>To share a mail folder with other users on your network, or to view sharing
  information for a folder, begin from the Mail window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Within an IMAP account, select a folder that you want to share, or select
    a folder whose sharing privileges you want to view.

    <p>Folders listed under Local Folders, or folders listed under a POP mail
      account cannot be shared.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Open the Edit menu, and choose Folder Properties.</li>
  <li>Click the Sharing tab.</li>
  <li>Click Privileges. You may be prompted to enter your network user name and
    password.

    <p>The Privileges button is only available if the IMAP mail server allows
      you to set folder sharing privileges. If this button is not available,
      you can view the folder sharing privileges for this folder but cannot
      change them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Follow the instructions on the screen to add users and to set their
    folder access privileges.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Read privileges</strong>: Users can read messages and copy
        their contents, but they cannot modify or delete messages, or copy
        messages into the folder. Users can flag messages as read or unread.
        See <a href="#marking_or_flagging_messages">Marking or Flagging
        Messages</a> for instructions on flagging messages.</li>
      <li><strong>Read and Write privileges</strong>: In addition to Read
        privileges, users can modify and delete messages. Users can also copy
        or move messages into the folder.</li>
      <li><strong>Manage privileges</strong>: In addition to Read and Write
        privileges, users can add and remove users and change their folder
        permissions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Click OK to confirm your changes.</li>
  <li>Click OK to close the Folder Properties dialog box.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the list of folders for your mail account, a shared folder displays a
  distinctive folder icon to indicate that it is shared.</p>

<p>To send a message that tells others how they can subscribe to your shared
  folder, begin from the Mail window:</p>

<h2 id="tagging_messages">Tagging Messages</h2>

<p>You can apply tags to messages to help you organize and prioritize them.
  You can apply a standard color and tag text to messages, or you can create
  your own color and tag text to suit your needs.</p>

<p>One powerful way to use tags is to set up a message filter to
  automatically tag incoming messages from a specific sender. For example,
  you can set up a message filter so that incoming messages from your boss are
  tagged <q>Important</q> and appear in red. See
  <a href="#creating_message_filters">Creating Message Filters</a> for more
  information.</p>

<h3 id="applying_a_tag">Applying a Tag</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Select the message you want to tag.</li>
  <li>Open the Message menu, and choose Tag.</li>
  <li>Choose the tag you want to apply from the list.</li>
</ol>

<p>The message summary row changes to the color of the tag with the topmost
  priority. To see the tag text, you must display the Tags column in the Mail
  window.</p>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: To quickly tag messages or remove a tag, select
  one or more messages and press one of the number keys 1-9 on your keyboard.
  Press 0 to remove all tags.</p>

<p>To display the Tags column, begin from the Mail window:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Click the Show/Hide Columns icon <img src="images/columns.png" alt=""/>
    and select Tags from the list.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Message tags apply on a per-account basis. For
  example, if you move or copy a tagged message to another mail account, the
  tags are not preserved. Similarly, if you forward a tagged message to
  another recipient, the tags are not preserved. For IMAP mail accounts, if
  your IMAP server supports user-defined keywords, message tags will persist
  when you log in to your mail account from a different location.</p>

<p>[<a href="#organizing_your_messages">Return to beginning of section</a>]</p>

<h3 id="customizing_tags">Customizing Tags</h3>

<p>You can customize tag colors and text and their order to suit your needs.</p>

    can be up to 32 characters long.</li>
  <li>To change the tag color, click the color block next to that tag and
    select a new color.</li>
  <li>Click the Move Up and Move Down buttons to reorder the tags. Tags at
    the top will have higher priority when coloring messages.</li>
  <li>Click OK.</li>
</ol>

<p>Your changes are immediately applied to all tagged messages in all your
  mail accounts.</p>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: To undo all customizations and restore just the

<h2 id="creating_message_filters">Creating Message Filters</h2>

<p>Message filters allow you to manage and organize your messages. You can
  create message filters that &brandShortName; Mail &amp; Newsgroups uses to
  automatically perform certain actions on incoming messages based on criteria
  you specify. For example, you can create a message filter that automatically
  moves incoming messages to a particular folder. Message filters operate on a
  per-account basis.</p>

<p>If you are not already viewing the Message Filters dialog box, begin from
  the Mail window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the Tools menu and choose Message Filters. You see the Message
    Filters dialog box.</li>
  <li>If you have multiple mail accounts, choose the one to which you want to
    apply the filter.</li>
  <li>Click New. You use the Filter Rules dialog box to specify the types of
    messages to act on, and the actions you want the filter to perform.</li>
  <li>Type a name for the filter.</li>
  <li>Select when you want the filter to be applied. This setting enables you
    to define some filters to be applied in an automatic way (when checking
    mail), on demand (manually run), or both. <q>After classification</q> means
    that junk and phishing controls will be run before applying the
    filter.</li>
  <li>Select the matching option you want Mail to use: <q><em>all</em> of the
    following</q> conditions (criteria) you choose, <q><em>any</em> of the
    following</q> conditions you choose, or <q><em>all messages</em></q>.</li>
  <li>Use the drop-down lists to choose the search criteria (for example,
    <q>Subject</q>, <q>Sender</q>, <q>contains</q>, <q>doesn&apos;t
    contain</q>) and then type the text or phrase you want to match.

    <p><strong>Tip</strong>: To search for messages that contain a header not
      listed in the first drop-down menu (for example, if you want to search
      for messages that include the header Resent-From), choose Customize and
      type the header you want to search for. &brandShortName; Mail &amp;
      Newsgroups adds your custom header to the drop-down list, so you can then
      choose it to search for matching entries. Make sure you enter the custom
      header correctly, since Mail will only find entries that exactly match
      what you type.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Click <q>+</q> to add criteria and <q>-</q> to remove them.</li>
  <li>Use the list to choose the action you want the filter to perform on the
    messages (for example, Move Message To). Use <q>+</q> and <q>-</q> to add
    or remove additional actions.

    <p><strong>Tip</strong>: To automatically tag incoming messages, choose
      <q>Tag Message</q> from the drop-down list.</p>

    <p><strong>Tip</strong>: Message filters are applied one after another. It
      could be that you don&apos;t want all filters to be run if one or more
      messages match some conditions. For instance, you may want to tag all
      messages from your boss&apos;s email address as <q>Important</q>, and
      you may want all messages containing the word <q>Memorandum</q> in their
      subject to be moved to a folder named <q>Pending Reads</q>, but you
      don&apos;t want any message from your boss to be moved to another folder,
      even if it contains <q>Memorandum</q> in the subject. So the first
      message filter you define should match your boss&apos;s email address,
      and would contain two actions: <q>Tag Message</q> as <q>Important</q> and
      <q>Stop Filter Execution</q>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>If you have chosen <q>Move</q> or <q>Copy</q> message to a folder, then
    select a destination folder in which to store the messages, or create a
    new folder.</li>
  <li>Click OK to confirm your settings.</li>
  <li>To run filters on existing messages in a folder, select the folder
    in the bottom dropdown list and click the <q>Run Now</q> button.</li>
  <li>Click OK in the Message Filters dialog box. The filter begins filtering
    incoming messages as soon as you click OK.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: You can also run message filters manually at any
  time. In the Mail window, choose Tools, and then select Run Filters on Folder
  to apply filters to the current folder, or Run Filters on Message to apply
  filters to the selected message (if any).</p>

<p>To manage your filters, begin from the Mail window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the Tools menu and choose Message Filters. You see the Message
    Filters dialog box.</li>
  <li>If you have multiple mail accounts, choose the one to which you want to
    apply the filter.</li>
  <li>Choose from the following:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>To turn a filter on or off</strong>: Click the checkbox to
        the right of the filter name to enable it, or click it again to turn it
        off.</li>
      <li><strong>To edit a filter</strong>: Select the filter name and click
        Edit (or double-click the filter name). Use the Filter Rules dialog box
        to make your changes.</li>
      <li><strong>To delete a filter</strong>: Select the filter name and click
        Delete.</li>
      <li><strong>To change the order in which filters are applied</strong>: In
        the filter list, click a filter&apos;s name, and click <q>Move Up</q>
        or <q>Move Down</q> to move it.

        <p><strong>Note</strong>: Filters are applied to each incoming message
          in the order you choose, until a filter action results in the message
          being deleted or moved from the Inbox folder.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Click OK when you are done managing your filters. If you created a new
    filter, it begins filtering incoming messages as soon as you click OK.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you delete a folder that you&apos;ve been using to
  store filtered messages, the filter will no longer work. Incoming messages
  that match the filter criteria will appear in your Inbox. If you rename or
  move the folder, the filter will automatically update to use the renamed or
  moved folder.</p>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: If you have existing messages that you want to move to
  another folder, use the Run Filters on Messages option in the Tools menu.</p>

<p>[<a href="#organizing_your_messages">Return to beginning of section</a>]</p>

<h3 id="filtering_messages_from_a_specific_sender">Filtering Messages From a
  Specific Sender</h3>

<p>You can quickly create a filter for messages from a particular sender. For
  example, if you want to automatically move all incoming messages from your
  child&apos;s teacher into a folder called <q>School</q>, you can quickly set
  up a filter to do this.</p>

<p>To create a filter for messages from a specific sender, begin from the Mail
  window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select a message from a specific sender.</li>
  <li>Open the Message menu and choose Create Filter From Message. Or, in the
    message header pane, right click the sender name and choose Create Filter
    From.</li>
  <li>You see the Filter Rules dialog box. Using the sender&apos;s email
    address, &brandShortName; prefills the filter matching criteria and the
    filter action (Move Message to). You can change or add new rules to the
    matching criteria.</li>
  <li>Choose a destination folder in which to store the incoming messages from
    the specified sender, or create a new folder. You can also choose other
    actions for this filter, or change the default one.</li>
  <li>Note that, if you leave the filter name empty, &brandShortName; will
    provide a name for it based on the first criterion.</li>
  <li>Click OK to confirm your settings. You see the
    <a href="#creating_message_filters">Message Filters</a> dialog box, where
    you can create, delete, or edit message filters.</li>
  <li>Click OK. The filter begins filtering incoming messages from the

<p>To locate text in a single message, begin from the Mail window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the message, open the Edit menu, and choose Find in This
    Message.</li>
  <li>Type the text that you want to locate in the dialog box.</li>
  <li>Click Find to locate the first occurrence of the text.</li>
  <li>Continue clicking Find to locate additional occurrences, or click Cancel
    when you are done.</li>
  <li>Choose Find Again from the Edit menu to continue searching for the text
    throughout the rest of the message.</li>
</ol>

<p>To quickly search for messages in a selected folder by subject or sender,
  begin from the Mail window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>To the right of <q>Subject or Sender contains:</q>, type the subject text
    or sender name that you want to find. You can type only part of the subject
    or sender, or you can type the exact word or name that you want to find.

    <p>As soon as you stop typing, &brandShortName; Mail &amp; Newsgroups
      displays only those messages in the selected folder where the subject or
      sender contains the search text you entered.</p>

<h1 id="controlling_junk_mail">Controlling Junk Mail</h1>

<p>This section describes how to use &brandShortName;&apos;s Junk Mail Controls
to filter unwanted mail, and how phishing detection works.</p>

<div class="contentsBox">In this section:

  </ul>
</div>


<h2 id="using_junk_mail_controls">Using Junk Mail Controls</h2>

<p>&brandShortName;&apos;s Junk Mail Controls feature can evaluate your
  incoming messages and identify possible junk (or unsolicited) messages. The
  feature uses the Bayesian classification method. You first train
  &brandShortName; by showing it a bunch of mail that is junk, and a bunch of
  mail that is not. Then, you let it auto-classify new mail for you. If
  &brandShortName; makes any mistakes, you can correct them.</p>

<p>To use Junk Mail Controls:</p>

<ol>
  <li>First, train &brandShortName; to recognize Junk messages and Non-Junk
    messages. There are three ways to toggle junk status of the selected
    message(s):
    <ul>
      <li>Open the Message menu, select <q>Mark</q> and choose <q>As Junk</q>
        or <q>As Not Junk</q>.</li>
      <li>Click on the Junk toolbar button.</li>
      <li><img src="images/mail_junk_column.png" style="float:right" alt=""/>

        <p>Click to toggle the Junk Status column in the message list. (If you
          do not see it, click the right-most button (
          <img src="images/columns.png" alt=""/>) in the list header bar and
          select Junk Status from the pop-up menu.)</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>When you toggle junk status, a trash-can icon will appear or disappear
      in the Junk status column to indicate the junk status of the selected
      message.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>Open the Edit menu, and choose Mail &amp; Newsgroups Account Settings.
    You see the Mail &amp; Newsgroups Account Settings dialog box.</li>
  <li>Click the Junk Settings category for your mail account.</li>
  <li>Enable the feature and &brandShortName; will automatically classify
    incoming messages. (See
    <a href="#junk_controls_options">Junk Mail Controls Options</a>.
    Details on the other settings there can be found in the 
    <a href="mailnews_account_settings.xhtml#junk_settings">Junk Settings</a>
    preference panel description.)
  </li>
  <li>If you have trained it on virus mail, consider disabling the white
    listing (many mail viruses send bulk messages to people in the address book
    of the infected computer).</li>
  <li>Make sure to correct the Junk Mail Controls when it incorrectly labels
    messages either as junk or not junk.</li>
  <li>To analyze existing messages, select messages, open the Tools menu
    and choose <q>Run Junk Mail Controls</q>.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: &brandShortName; will only run Junk Mail Controls
  when the training database has information on non-Junk messages. If Junk Mail
  Controls do not work, select some messages and explicitly mark them as Not
  Junk.</p>

<p>[<a href="#controlling_junk_mail">Return to beginning of section</a>]</p>

<h2 id="junk_controls_options">Junk Mail Controls Options</h2>

<p>To fine-tune how Junk Mail Controls work, use the 
  <a href="mailnews_preferences.xhtml#junk_and_suspect_preferences">Junk &amp;
  Suspect Mail preference panel</a> for account-independent settings and the
  account manager's <a href="mailnews_account_settings.xhtml#junk_settings">Junk
  Settings</a> for settings of a specific mail account.</p>

<p>[<a href="#controlling_junk_mail">Return to beginning of section</a>]</p>

<h2 id="junk_controls_and_filters">Junk Mail Controls and Filters</h2>

<p>Junk Mail Controls run after mail filters (unless you set the filter to run
  after classification, where <q>classification</q> includes junk and phishing
  scanning) and apply only to the Inbox folder and its sub-folders. Use this to
  your advantage, for example, you can filter mail you are sure not to be Junk
  to a special folder outside of Inbox so that the messages will not be
  classified as Junk (especially useful if you subscribe to newsletters or if
  you are on a moderated mailing list).</p>

<p>[<a href="#controlling_junk_mail">Return to beginning of section</a>]</p>

<h2 id="phishing_detection">Phishing Detection</h2>

<p>Phishing is a particularly common fraudulent business scheme in which
  a party creates counterfeit websites designed to trick recipients into
  divulging personal data such as credit card numbers, account usernames,
  passwords and social security numbers. Hijacking brand names of banks,
  e-retailers and credit card companies, phishers often convince
  recipients to respond.</p>

<p>In many cases, you&apos;ll receive a link to a phishing page via an email
  which claims to come from an official-looking address. You can also end up
  at these pages by following links that you find on the Web or in IM
  messages.</p>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: Since a forged <a href="glossary.xhtml#url">URL</a>
  can look very similar to a genuine one, it&apos;s safer to use a bookmark
  you&apos;ve created or to type the URL into the location bar by hand instead
  of following a link in an email message. Always consider the risk of a forged
  URL if you&apos;re asked to log in or provide private information on a
  website.</p>

<p>&brandShortName; Mail phishing detector is enabled by default. When it
  encounters a mail which seems to be scam, it will show a warning bar in the
  message window.</p>

<p>If you think that the email is a valid one, you can click on the <q>Not
  Scam</q> button, and the warning bar will disappear.</p>

<p>When a user clicks on a link in an email that appears to be a phishing URL,
  &brandShortName; will prompt the user with a dialog box before the website
  is opened.</p>

<p>This prompt will appear if either of the following is true: the host name of
  the actual URL is an <a href="glossary.xhtml#ip_address">IP address</a>, or
  the link text is a URL whose host name does not match the host name of the
  actual URL.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Phishing detection has a higher precedence than Junk
  Mail detection.</p>

<p>For more technical details on this subject, see the online document
  <a href="http://www.honeynet.org/papers/phishing/">Know your Enemy:
  Phishing</a>.</p>

</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> don&apos;t confuse a feed with a folder in a Blogs
  &amp; News account. Removing a feed doesn&apos;t delete the folder in which
  the feed articles are stored, and thus, such articles will stay in the folder
  until you delete either the whole folder or the articles themselves. To get
  a better understanding, see <a href="#organizing_your_feeds">Organizing your

<h2 id="using_different_blogs_and_news_feeds_accounts">Using different blogs
  &amp; news feeds accounts</h2>

<p>A single blogs &amp; news feeds account can contain any number of feeds in
  it, so you don&apos;t strictly need more than one blogs &amp; news feeds
  account. However, you may want to create several blogs &amp; news feeds
  accounts. Some reasons to do that are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can use different accounts to categorize your feeds. For example, you
    can create an account named <q>Mozilla News</q> to put in it all your
    feeds related to Mozilla, and another one named <q>Today Headlines</q> to
    put in it all your feeds with general news.</li>
  <li>If you have several accounts, each one can have different settings. This
    way, you can choose, for example, different time intervals for each account
    (and, therefore, their feeds.)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="organizing_your_feeds">Organizing your feeds</h2>

<p>The default operation mode when adding a feed to a Blogs &amp; News Feeds
  account in &brandShortName; is to create a folder and a feed inside it.
  However, &brandShortName; allows you a great deal of flexibility. This section
  helps you to better organize your feeds:</p>

<h3 id="feeds_vs_folders">Feeds versus folders</h3>

<p>Blogs &amp; News Feeds accounts are organized through two main concepts:
  <strong>feeds</strong> and <strong>folders</strong>.</p>
  
<ul>
  <li><strong>Feeds</strong> are sources for articles/posts. They provide
    the means to get new articles from blogs. You subscribe to feeds.</li>
  <li><strong>Folders</strong> in Blogs &amp; News Feeds accounts work pretty
    much like in any other account type. Folders store articles/posts you got
    through the feeds.</li>
</ul>

<p>You use the Feed Subscriptions dialog to tell &brandShortName; which feed
  messages are downloaded in which folders. As feeds provide new articles and
  folders provide the store to put such articles, you will want to have them
  connected, usually linking a feed to a folder. However, keep in mind that
  removing a feed will not automatically delete the associated folder, nor
  will remove the articles/posts from the removed feed, since they are
  stored into the folder.</p>

<h3 id="organizing_folders_in_blogs_and_news_feeds_accounts">Organizing folders
  in Blogs &amp; News Feeds accounts</h3>

<p>You can create, rename, move or copy folders in Blogs &amp; News Feeds
  accounts just like with any other account type. See

<p>You may want to use a single folder to store articles/items coming from

  that folder. Begin from the Mail window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>In the accounts pane, click your desired Blogs &amp; News Feeds account
    to manage, or a feed inside it.</li>
  <li>Open the File menu and choose Subscribe (or use any other of the

  &brandShortName; Mail &amp; Newsgroups to Work Offline</h2>

<p>&brandShortName; Mail &amp; Newsgroups&apos; offline feature lets you
  download your mail and read it offline (while disconnected from the
  Internet). If you use a dial-up (modem) connection to access your mail and
  you want to reduce the time you are connected, or, if you need to temporarily
  disconnect from your company&apos;s network while traveling or switching
  locations, you can download your mail so that you can read it offline. The
  offline feature can automatically download incoming messages and then later
  send all your outgoing messages when you reconnect.</p>

<p>Note that for POP accounts your mail is already downloaded by default, so
  most of these offline features aren&apos;t relevant for POP accounts.</p>

<p>If you occasionally want to work offline, &brandShortName; Mail &amp;
  Newsgroups lets you easily:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Download your Inbox for offline use.</li>
  <li>Download an individual folder for offline use.</li>
  <li>Download only selected or flagged messages for offline use.</li>
  <li>Download directory entries in your address book for offline use.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you frequently work offline, &brandShortName; Mail &amp; Newsgroups also
  lets you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Set up one or more of your accounts for offline use.</li>
  <li>Set offline and disk space preferences for each account.</li>
  <li>Select the folders and newsgroups that you want to view offline.</li>
</ul>

<p>[<a href="#working_offline">Return to beginning of section</a>]</p>

<h2 id="downloading_all_messages_for_offline_use">Downloading All Messages for
  Offline Use</h2>

<p>You can tell &brandShortName; Mail &amp; Newsgroups to automatically
  download your messages for offline use. Later, when you go back online,
  &brandShortName; Mail &amp; Newsgroups automatically synchronizes your
  messages with the server.</p>

<p>Note that the Inbox for POP accounts is downloaded by default, so this
  section does not apply for POP accounts.</p>

<p>To automatically download your messages for offline use, begin from the Mail
  window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the Edit menu and choose Mail &amp; Newsgroups Account Settings. You
    see the Mail &amp; Newsgroups Account Settings dialog box.</li>
  <li>In the left side of the dialog box, under the name of the account you
    want to use offline, select Synchronization &amp; Storage. (This category
    is not available for POP accounts.)</li>
  <li>Check the box labeled <q>Keep messages for this account on this
    computer</q>.</li>
  <li>Click OK.</li>
  <li>Click the Online/Offline indicator <img src="images/online.png" alt=""/>
    in the lower right corner of the Mail window (to the left of the Cookie
    icon) to go offline. You will be asked to download messages for them to be
    available while offline. Click on <q>Download</q> to proceed.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: This setting also applies to any new folders
  created. While the per-account setting can be overridden for an
  <a href="#downloading_an_individual_folder_for_offline_use">individual
  folder</a>, those per-folder settings are <em>removed</em> when the
  <q>Keep messages</q> box is toggled.</p>

<p>&brandShortName; Mail &amp; Newsgroups automatically downloads all messages
  in your Inbox so you can read and respond to them while working offline.
  After disconnecting, &brandShortName; Mail &amp; Newsgroups remains open so
  you can continue to work with your messages.</p>

<p>To reconnect to the Internet so you can work online:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Click the Online/Offline indicator <img src="images/offline.png"
    alt=""/> in the lower right corner of the Mail window (to the left of the
    Cookie icon) to go back online.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you go back online, &brandShortName; Mail &amp; Newsgroups
  automatically synchronizes your Inbox messages with the server, by
  replicating any changes you made while working offline.</p>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: &brandShortName; Mail &amp; Newsgroups saves any
  messages that you send while working offline in the Unsent Messages folder
  under Local Folders. To have &brandShortName; Mail &amp; Newsgroups
  automatically send your unsent messages when you reconnect, use the
  Preferences command on the <span class="mac">&brandShortName;</span>

<h2 id="downloading_an_individual_folder_for_offline_use">Downloading an
  Individual Folder for Offline Use</h2>

<p>Note that POP accounts don&apos;t allow you to manage folders on the POP
  server, so this section does not apply to POP accounts.</p>

<p>To download a specific folder for offline use, begin from the Mail
  window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>In the left side of the Mail window, select the folder that you want to
    download for offline use.</li>
  <li>Open the Edit menu, and choose Folder Properties. You see the Properties
    dialog box.</li>
  <li>Click the Synchronization tab.</li>
  <li>Check <q>Select this folder for offline use</q>.</li>
  <li>Click Download Now if you want to immediately begin downloading the
    folder&apos;s messages. Alternatively, you can continue working, and when
    you are ready to go offline, proceed to the next step.</li>
  <li>Click the Online/Offline indicator <img src="images/online.png" alt=""/>
    in the lower right corner of the Mail window to go offline.</li>
  <li>In the Work Offline dialog box, click Download.</li>
</ol>

<p>&brandShortName; Mail &amp; Newsgroups automatically downloads all messages
  in the selected folder so you can read and respond to them while working
  offline. After disconnecting, &brandShortName; Mail &amp; Newsgroups remains
  open so you can continue to work with your messages.</p>

  working offline.</p>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: &brandShortName; Mail &amp; Newsgroups saves any
  messages that you sent while working offline in the Unsent Messages folder
  under Local Folders. When you reconnect, choose Send Unsent Messages from the
  File menu to send all your saved messages at once. To have &brandShortName;

<h2 id="downloading_selected_or_flagged_messages_for_offline_use">Downloading
  Selected or Flagged Messages for Offline Use</h2>

<p>Note that messages are downloaded by default for POP accounts. However, if
  you have enabled the <q>Fetch headers only</q> setting in the POP account
  settings, then only the headers will be downloaded, and you will need to use

<h2 id="downloading_directory_entries_for_offline_use">Downloading
  Directory Entries for Offline Use</h2>

<p>You can download (replicate) the entries in a directory server to your
  computer so that they are available when you work offline. Once you&apos;ve
  downloaded directory entries, you can use the same procedure to update your
  local copy of the entries with the latest entries on the directory
  server.</p>

<p>To download or update an address book LDAP directory for offline use:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Make sure you&apos;re online.</li>
  <li>Open the Window menu, and choose Address Book.</li>
  <li>In the Address Book window, select the directory that you want to
    download (replicate).</li>
  <li>Click Properties in the Address Book toolbar. The Directory Server
    Properties dialog box appears.</li>
  <li>Click the Offline tab.</li>
  <li>Click Download Now to start copying the entries to your computer.</li>
  <li>If prompted, enter your network user name and password, and click OK to
    start the download.

    <p>Depending on the number of directory entries, the download process may
      take a while, so please be patient.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>After the download finishes, you can work offline and search the directory
  or use it for address autocompletion when composing messages. After
  you&apos;ve been using your local copy of the directory for a while, you may
  wish to update it to get the latest entries from the directory server. To
  update your local copy, use the procedure described above.</p>

<h2 id="setting_up_your_accounts_for_working_offline">Setting Up Your Accounts
  for Working Offline</h2>

<p>To set up one or more accounts for working offline, you use the Offline and
  Disk Space preferences in the Mail &amp; Newsgroups Account Settings dialog
  box. Once set, you don&apos;t need to change these preferences each time you
  want to work offline. The offline and disk space preferences you can set for
  an account depend on the type of account (IMAP, POP, or Newsgroup).</p>

<p>Here&apos;s a summary of the steps you will follow to set up your accounts
  for offline use:</p>

<ol>
  <li>For each account that you want to work with while offline, use the Mail
    &amp; Newsgroups Account Settings dialog box to set the Synchronization
    &amp; Storage preferences for that account. You must select the items
    (folders and newsgroups) that you want to download for offline use. See
    <a href="#selecting_items_for_offline_viewing">Selecting Items for Offline
    Viewing</a> for more information.

    <p>Once set, you don&apos;t need to change these settings. See the sections
      below for information on setting offline and disk space preferences for
      <a href="mailnews_account_settings.xhtml#synchronization_and_storage_settings_imap">IMAP</a>,
      <a href="mailnews_account_settings.xhtml#disk_space_settings_pop">POP</a>,

      <a href="mailnews_account_settings.xhtml#synchronization_and_storage_settings_nntp">Newsgroup</a>
      accounts.</p>

    <p><strong>Tip</strong>: To set the Synchronization &amp; Storage
      preferences for the current account, open the File menu, choose Offline,
      and then choose Offline Settings.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Open the File menu, choose Offline, and then choose Download/Sync Now
    from the submenu.</li>
  <li>Select the type of messages (mail or newsgroup or both) that you want to
    download.

    <p><strong>Important</strong>: You must select at least one category (mail
      messages or newsgroup messages) in order for the download to work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Select <q>Work offline once download and/or sync is complete</q>.</li>
  <li>Click OK to download the selected items and then go offline. See
    <a href="#downloading_and_synchronizing_your_messages">Downloading and
    Synchronizing Your Messages</a> for more information.</li>
</ol>

<p>For subsequent offline sessions, you can skip step 1.</p>

<h2 id="selecting_items_for_offline_viewing">Selecting Items for Offline
  Viewing</h2>

<p>Before you can read mail and newsgroup messages while offline, you must
  first select them for downloading. You can set up an entire account for
  offline use. You can also choose which folders and newsgroups that you
  want to use offline.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Keep in mind that selecting more items may increase
  download time and disk space used.</p>

<p>To select accounts, folders, and newsgroups for offline viewing, begin from
  the Mail window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the Edit menu, choose Mail &amp; Newsgroups Account Settings. You
    see the Mail &amp; Newsgroups Account Settings dialog box.</li>
  <li>Choose the Synchronization &amp; Storage category for the account you
    want to change.</li>
  <li>Click <q>Advanced</q> to see your IMAP folders, or <q>Select newsgroups
    for offline use</q> for your subscribed newsgroups.

    <p><strong>Note</strong>: You see only the newsgroups and folders that
      you&apos;ve already <a href="#subscribing_to_newsgroups">subscribed</a>
      to. POP accounts and local mail folders don&apos;t appear in the
      list.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Select the items (folders, newsgroups) that you want to make available
    for offline use.</li>
  <li>Click OK.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once set, you don&apos;t need to change these settings each time you want to
  go offline. However, if you do want to change them, you can easily do so
  before going offline, since the same Select button is available when using
  the <a href="#downloading_and_synchronizing_your_messages">Download and
  Sync</a> command.</p>

<p>[<a href="#working_offline">Return to beginning of section</a>]</p>

      items to download. Use the Select button to select items to download.</p>
  </li>
  <li>To send messages in your Unsent Messages folder before going offline,
    check <q>Send Unsent Messages</q>.</li>
