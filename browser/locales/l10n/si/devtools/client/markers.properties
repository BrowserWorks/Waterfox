# LOCALIZATION NOTE These strings are used inside the Performance Tools
# which is available from the Web Developer sub-menu -> 'Performance'.
# The correct localization of this file might be to keep it in
# English, or another language commonly spoken among web developers.

# A good criteria is the language in which you'd find the best
# documentation on web development on the web. These strings
# are specifically for marker names in the performance tool.
