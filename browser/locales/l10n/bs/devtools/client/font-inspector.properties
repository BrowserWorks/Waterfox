# (groups of settings that apply in bulk to a thing). Instances have names. When the user
# creates a new instance, it doesn't have a name. This is the text that appears as the
# default name for a new instance. It shows up in a dropdown from which users can select
# between predefined instances and this custom instance.
fontinspector.customInstanceName=PrilagoÄ‘eno

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (fontinspector.fontInstanceLabel): This label is shown next to the UI
# in the font editor which allows a user to select a font instance option from a
# dropdown. An instance is like a preset. A "font instance" is the term used by the font
# authors to mean a group of predefined font settings.
