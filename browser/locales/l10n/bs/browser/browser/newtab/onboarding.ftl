### UI strings for the simplified onboarding modal / about:welcome
### Various strings use a non-breaking space to avoid a single dangling /
### widowed word, so test on various window sizes if you also want this.


## These button action text can be split onto multiple lines, so use explicit
## newlines in translations to control where the line break appears (e.g., to
## avoid breaking quoted text).


## Welcome modal dialog strings

onboarding-cards-dismiss =
    .title = Odbaci
    .aria-label = Odbaci

## Multistage 3-screen onboarding flow strings (about:welcome pages)


## Please make sure to split the content of the title attribute into lines whose
## width corresponds to about 40 Latin characters, to ensure that the tooltip
## doesn't become too long. Line breaks will be preserved when displaying the
## tooltip.

## Firefox Sync modal dialog strings.


## This is part of the line "Enter your email to continue to Firefox Sync"


## These are individual benefit messages shown with an image, title and
