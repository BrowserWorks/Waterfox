## The Enterprise Policies feature is aimed at system administrators
## who want to deploy these settings across several Waterfox installations
## all at once. This is traditionally done through the Windows Group Policy
## feature, but the system also supports other forms of deployment.
## These are short descriptions for individual policies, to be displayed
## in the documentation section in about:policies.

policy-AppUpdateURL = Aiftar una URL personalizada d'anovamientu de l'aplicación.

policy-Authentication = Configurar l'autenticación integrada pa sitios web que l'admitan.

policy-BlockAboutAddons = Bloquiar l'accesu al alministrador de complementos (about:addons).
