# LOCALIZATION_NOTE(binaryComponentKnown): This is shown when Lightning is
# missing the binary component and knows how to calculate the expected version
# number. To test, remove the binary component from the components/
# subdirectory and start Lightning, or force install into a different
# Thunderbird version. In the last part of the sentence it should be made clear
# that the user can install e.g. 3.7, 3.7.1 or anything other 3.7.x version
# %1$S - The Lightning brand name, from the brandShortName string above.
# %2$S - The current Lightning version
# %3$S - The expected Lightning version
binaryComponentKnown=The binary component required for %1$S could not be loaded, likely because the wrong version combination is being used. You currently have %1$S %2$S installed, but should be using a version from the %3$S series.

# LOCALIZATION_NOTE(binaryComponentUnknown): This is shown when Lightning is
# missing the binary component but can't calculate the expected version. This
# happens in the rare case that Lightning is installed into something other
# than Thunderbird or Seamonkey. You may link to a different page if you can
# commit to keeping it up to date, I'd recommend staying with the English page.
# %1$S - The Lightning brand name, from the brandShortName string above.
# %2$S - The application brand name, e.g. Postbox
# %3$S - The application version
# %3$S - The current Lightning version
binaryComponentUnknown=The binary component required for %1$S could not be loaded, likely because the wrong version combination is being used. You are using %2$S %3$S together with %1$S %4$S. Please check https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Calendar/Calendar_Versions for details.

# LOCALIZATION_NOTE(binaryComponentTitle): The title for the dialog that
# notifies about a version mismatch.
# %1$S - The Lightning brand name, from the brandShortName string above.
binaryComponentTitle=Mismatching %1$S Version

# LOCALIZATION NOTE(noIdentitySelectedNotification):
noIdentitySelectedNotification=If you want to use this calendar to store invitations to or from other people you should assign an email identity below.
