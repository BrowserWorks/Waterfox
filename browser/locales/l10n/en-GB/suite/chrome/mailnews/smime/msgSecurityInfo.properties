## Signature Information strings
SINoneLabel=Message Has No Digital Signature
SINone=This message does not include the sender's digital signature. The absence of a digital signature means that the message could have been sent by someone pretending to have this email address. It is also possible that the message has been altered while in transit over the network. However, it is unlikely that either event has occurred.

SIValidLabel=Message Is Signed
SIValid=This message includes a valid digital signature. The message has not been altered since it was sent.

SIInvalidLabel=Digital Signature Is Not Valid
SIInvalidHeader=This message includes a digital signature, but the signature is invalid.

SIContentAltered=The signature does not match the message content correctly. The message appears to have been altered after the sender signed it. You should not trust the validity of this message until you verify its contents with the sender.
SIExpired=The certificate used to sign the message appears to have expired. Make sure your computer's clock is set correctly.
SIRevoked=The certificate used to sign the message has been revoked. You should not trust the validity of this message until you verify its contents with the sender.
SINotYetValid=The certificate used to sign the message appears not to be valid yet. Make sure your computer's clock is set correctly.
SIUnknownCA=The certificate used to sign the message was issued by an unknown certificate authority.
SIUntrustedCA=The certificate used to sign the message was issued by a certificate authority that you do not trust for issuing this kind of certificate.
SIExpiredCA=The certificate used to sign the message was issued by a certificate authority whose own certificate has expired. Make sure your computer's clock is set correctly.
SIRevokedCA=The certificate used to sign the message was issued by a certificate authority whose own certificate has been revoked. You should not trust the validity of this message until you verify its contents with the sender.
SINotYetValidCA=The certificate used to sign the message was issued by a certificate authority whose own certificate is not yet valid. Make sure your computer's clock is set correctly.
SIInvalidCipher=The message was signed using an encryption strength that this version of your software does not support.
SIClueless=There are unknown problems with this digital signature. You should not trust the validity of this message until you verify its contents with the sender.

SIPartiallyValidLabel=Message is signed
SIPartiallyValidHeader=Although the digital signature is valid, it is unknown whether sender and signer are the same person.

EINone=This message was not encrypted before it was sent. Information sent over the Internet without encryption can be seen by other people while in transit.

EIValidLabel=Message Is Encrypted
EIValid=This message was encrypted before it was sent to you. Encryption makes it very difficult for other people to view information while it is travelling over the network.
