<p><strong>What are Popups?</strong></p>

<p>Pop-up windows, or popups, are windows that appear automatically and without
  your permission. They vary in size, but usually don&apos;t cover the whole
  screen. Some popups open on top of the current browser window, thus popping
  up, while others appear underneath the browser (popunders).</p>

<p>&brandShortName; allows you to control both popups and popunders through the
  <a href="#privacy_and_security_preferences_popup_windows">Popup Windows
  preferences panel</a>. Since popup blocking is turned off by default, you
  must enable it to prevent popups from appearing in the browser.</p>

<p>When blocking a popup, &brandShortName; can be set up to play a sound or
  display an icon
  <img src="chrome://navigator/skin/icons/popup-blocked.png" alt="Popup control
  icon"/> in the status bar or a notification bar at the top of the web site
  content area, or any combination of the above. You can use the icon or the
  bar to add a web site you&apos;re viewing to an exceptions list so that the
  web site is allowed to again display popups.</p>

<p><strong>Blocking popups may interfere with some web sites</strong>: Some
  web sites, including some banking sites, use popups for important features.
  Blocking all popups disables such features. To allow specific web sites to
  use popups, while blocking all others, you can add specific web sites to the
  list of allowed web sites. For more information, see
  <a href="#privacy_and_security_preferences_popup_windows">Privacy &amp;
  Security Preferences - Popup Windows</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Blocking popups doesn&apos;t always work</strong>: Although
  &brandShortName; blocks most popups, some web sites, even when blocked, may
  use other methods to show popups.</p>

<p><strong>Allowing popups from certain web sites</strong>: After you&apos;ve
  enabled popup blocking, you can still allow specific web sites to display
  popups. Browse to the web site, and then from the Tools menu, choose Popup
  Manager, and then choose Allow Popups From This Web Site.</p>

<p>The next section describes how to control popups through preferences and
  through the popup control icon.</p>

<h2 id="privacy_and_security_preferences_popup_windows">Privacy &amp; Security
  Preferences - Popup Windows</h2>

<p>This section describes how to use the Popup Windows preferences panel. If
  you&apos;re not already viewing it, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the
    <span class="mac">&brandShortName;</span>
    <span class="noMac">Edit</span> menu and choose Preferences.</li>
  <li>Under the Privacy &amp; Security Preferences category, click Popup
    Windows. (If no subcategories are visible, double-click Privacy &amp;
    Security to expand the list.)</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Block unrequested popup windows</strong>: Select this to prevent
    popups from appearing in the browser.</li>
  <li><strong>Allowed Web Sites</strong>: Click this to view and edit the list
    of web sites that you want to allow to display popups.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Allowed Web Sites - Popups</strong>: The list of allowed
        web sites appears when you click <q>Allowed Sites</q>. You can add or
        remove web sites that should be allowed to show popups.</li>
      <li><strong>Allow</strong>: Click this after typing in a web site that you
        want to add to the list.</li>
      <li><strong>Remove Web Site</strong>: Click this to remove a selected
        web site.</li>
      <li><strong>Remove All Web Sites</strong>: Click this to remove all of the
        web sites in the current list.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>When a popup window has been blocked</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Play a sound</strong>: If you want a sound to play each time
    the browser blocks a popup, select this option and choose System beep
    or Custom sound file. Selecting Custom sound file enables the following two
    buttons:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Browse</strong>: Click this to choose a sound file.</li>
      <li><strong>Play</strong>: Click this to listen to the chosen
        sound.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Display an icon in the browser status bar</strong>: Select this
    to display an icon
    <img src="chrome://navigator/skin/icons/popup-blocked.png" alt="Popup control
    icon"/> in the browser status bar to indicate that a popup is blocked.

    <p><strong>Note</strong>: After the popup control icon
      <img src="chrome://navigator/skin/icons/popup-blocked.png" alt="Popup
      control icon"/> appears, it remains visible until you visit another
      web site.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Display a notification bar at the top of the content area</strong>:
    Select this to display a notification bar above the web site content area
    whenever a popup is blocked. In the bar, use the Preferences button to choose
    how to handle popups from that web site.
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Using the popup control icon or notification bar to add allowed
  web sites</strong>: You can use the popup control icon or notification bar to
  quickly add a web site to the list of allowed web sites. Click the icon
  <img src="chrome://navigator/skin/icons/popup-blocked.png" alt="Popup control
  icon"/> to open the list of allowed web sites. The current web site is
  already filled in. Click Allow and then click OK to confirm your addition.
  Similarly you can use the notification bar to allow popups from the current
  web site or open the list of allowed web sites through Manage Popups. Just
  click the Preferences button at the right end of the notification bar.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Blocking popups may not always work and may interfere
  with some web sites. For more information about blocking popups, see
  <a href="#controlling_popups">Controlling Popups</a>.</p>
