# LOCALIZATION NOTE(selfsigned_warning): %1$S will be the hostname of the server the user was trying to connect to.

cleartext_details=Insecure mail servers do not use encrypted connections to protect your passwords and private information. By connecting to this server you could expose your password and private information.

Of course, it may still be wrong, but it often works.
