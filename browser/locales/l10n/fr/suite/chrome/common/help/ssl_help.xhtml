<h1 id="ssltls_settings">SSL/TLS Settings</h1>

<p>This section describes how to set your SSL/TLS preferences.</p>

<div class="contentsBox">In this section:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#privacy_and_security_preferences_ssltls">Privacy &amp; Security
      Preferences - SSL/TLS</a></li>

<p>This section describes how to use the SSL/TLS preferences panel. If you are
  not already viewing the panel, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the <span class="mac">&brandShortName;</span>
    <span class="noMac">Edit</span> menu and choose Preferences.</li>
  <li>Under the Privacy &amp; Security category, click SSL/TLS. (If no
    subcategories are visible, double-click Privacy &amp; Security to expand
    the list.)</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="ssltls_protocol_versions">SSL/TLS Protocol Versions</h3>

<p>The <a href="glossary.xhtml#ssl">Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)</a> protocol
  and its successor, the <a href="glossary.xhtml#tls">Transport Layer Security
  (TLS)</a> protocol, are standards which define rules governing mutual
  authentication between a website and browser software and the encryption
  of information that flows between them.  They are also used for secure
  communication in various other protocols, e.g., for protection of sensitive
  information exchanged with email, calendar, or directory servers.</p>

<p>The SSL 2.0 and SSL 3.0 protocols are insecure and thus deprecated. The
  current TLS protocol is based on SSL but with its own version numbering.
  TLS 1.0 can be thought of as SSL 3.1, TLS 1.1 is in turn an update to TLS
  1.0, etc. Newer protocols are preferred over older ones as they provide
  better security and more features. Older protocols are supported to ensure
  compatibility.</p>

<p>By default, &brandShortName; will select the most secure version which is
  widely supported to connect to the server. If that attempt doesn&apos;t
  succeed, it will try to connect with the next older version, etc., to the
  extent allowed by the settings in this panel. The connection will fail if no
  protocol supported by both sides is found. You can exclude older versions
  explicitly or allow newer versions which may not be widely supported yet
  with the following options:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Enable</strong>: Check the <strong>TLS 1.0</strong>,
    <strong>TLS 1.1</strong>, and/or <strong>TLS 1.2</strong>
    boxes to indicate which protocol versions can be used for a secure
    connection to a server.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>At least one protocol version must be selected, thus it is not possible
    to uncheck the last remaining box.</li>
  <li>Also, the selection must be contiguous. It is not possible to select both
    TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.2 but to exclude the intermediate TLS 1.1 version.</li>
  <li>You can extend the range by multiple versions. For example, if only TLS
    1.0 is currently checked and you select TLS 1.2, the TLS 1.1 version is
     automatically selected as well.</li>
  <li>Checkboxes may appear checked but grayed out if you cannot uncheck them
    without violating these rules. Uncheck the outermost boxes to regain
    access to an enclosed intermediate version.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ssltls_warnings">SSL/TLS Warnings</h3>

<p>It&apos;s easy to tell when the website you are viewing is using an encrypted
  connection. If the connection is encrypted, the lock icon in the lower-right
  corner of the browser window is locked
  (<img src="chrome://communicator/skin/icons/lock-secure.png"/>). If the
  connection is not encrypted, the lock icon is unlocked
  (<img src="chrome://communicator/skin/icons/lock-insecure.png"/>). Encrypted
  pages which contain some unencrypted items (mixed content) are shown with a
  broken-lock icon
  (<img src="chrome://communicator/skin/icons/lock-broken.png"/>).</p>

<p>If you want additional warnings, you can select one or more of the warning
  checkboxes in the SSL/TLS preferences panel. Unless stated otherwise, a
  notification bar will be presented at the top of the page triggering the
  alert, with an option to enter this panel to change the option if the alert
  is considered annoying.</p>

<p>To activate any of these warnings, select the corresponding checkbox:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Loading a page that supports encryption</strong>: Select this
    warning if you want to be reminded whenever you are loading a page that
    supports encryption.</li>
  <li><strong>Leaving a page that supports encryption</strong>: Select this
    warning if you want to be reminded whenever you are leaving a page that
    supports encryption for one that does not.</li>
  <li><strong>Sending form data from an unencrypted page to an unencrypted
    page</strong>: Select this warning if you want to be alerted whenever you
    are submitting data over an unencrypted connection. When this option is
    selected, a dialog box will be presented to the user <em>before</em> the
    page is actually opened, which allows the loading of the page to be
    canceled before any potentially sensitive information is sent over an
    unencrypted connection that can easily be intercepted by others.

    <p><strong>Note</strong>: Submitting a form from an encrypted to an
      unencrypted page will always prompt a dialog prior to opening the page,
      regardless of this setting.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="mixed_content">Mixed Content</h3>

<p>In general, there are two major issues related to transmitting sensitive
  information over an unencrypted connection: One is the danger of someone
  eavesdropping on the line, thus listening to the content transmitted; the
  other of someone intercepting requests for the desired page and replacing
  the legitimate content of that page with own (potentially malicious)
  content. While so-called <q>Man In The Middle</q> attacks can usually be
  detected in encrypted connections (e.g., by a certificate mismatch or an
  invalid certificate presented by the interceptor), no such verification
  exists for unencrypted connections.</p>

<p>The term <q>Mixed Content</q> refers to a web page which itself is
  encrypted, but which includes content on the same or a different server
  which is <em>not</em> encrypted. Consequently, this part of the page is
  still subject to the vulnerabilities of an unencrypted line. While there
  are legitimate uses of that concept (such as including a company logo from
  a different insecure website into an otherwise secure page), such designs
  should be avoided.</p>

<p>There are two general types of mixed content:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Mixed Active Content</strong> (or Mixed Script Content): This
    is content which has the potential to hide or modify parts of a web page,
    or to actively leak content from the secure part of the page to its
    insecure part. Examples include scripts (JavaScript), style sheets (CSS),
    or the embedding of entire web pages into the main web page (iframes).</li>
  <li><strong>Mixed Passive Content</strong> (or Mixed Display Content):
    This type of content does <em>not</em> have the potential to alter or
    monitor the web page as such. Examples include images and audio or video
    streams. It is however possible that sensitive information is passed as
    an encoding of the content&apos;s location (URL), as cookies, or returned
    with the content itself (e.g., as text included in an image). Thus, passive
    content isn&apos;t entirely harmless either.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following options allow you to be warned about and/or to block both
  mixed active and mixed passive content:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Warn me when encrypted pages contain insecure content</strong>:
    Check this to instruct &brandShortName; to present a notification bar when
    mixed <em>active</em> content was loaded or blocked. The notification bar
    contains a button to open this preference panel.</li>
  <li><strong>Don&apos;t load insecure content on encrypted pages</strong>:
    Check this to prevent mixed active content from being loaded at all but
    to be blocked. If also the <q>Warn me</q> option is checked, the
    notification bar will contain two additional buttons:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Keep Blocking</strong>: Dismiss the notification bar without
        loading the potentially insecure content.</li>
      <li><strong>Unblock</strong>:
        Load the potentially insecure content <em>once</em> but not
        automatically when this page is visited again in the future.</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Note</strong>: The selection of <q>Unblock</q> for a specific site
    can be revoked in the Permissions tab of the Data Manager. When in a
    <a href="using_priv_help.xhtml#browsing_in_a_private_window">private
    window</a>, these options aren&apos;t available in the notification bar.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Warn me when encrypted pages contain other types of mixed
    content</strong>: Check this to instruct &brandShortName; to present a
    notification bar when mixed <em>passive</em> content was loaded or blocked.
    The notification bar contains a button to open this preference panel.</li>
  <li><strong>Don&apos;t load other types of mixed content on encrypted
    pages</strong>: Check this to prevent mixed passive content from being
    loaded at all but to be blocked. If also the <q>Warn me</q> option is
    checked, a notification is presented that such content was blocked.</li>
</ul>
