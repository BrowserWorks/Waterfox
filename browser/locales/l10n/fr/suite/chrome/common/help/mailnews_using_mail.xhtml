<h2 id="getting_new_messages">Getting New Messages</h2>

<p>For an IMAP account, you can retrieve new messages automatically and display
  them in the Inbox by opening Mail &amp; Newsgroups and selecting the Inbox
  for the IMAP account.</p>

<p>For a POP account, you must select the Inbox and click Get Msgs to retrieve
  your messages. By default, messages from your POP account are downloaded in
  full and deleted from the POP server when you retrieve them. You can
  <a href="mailnews_account_settings.xhtml#pop_server_settings">change your POP
  server settings</a> to retrieve just the headers and/or store a copy of
  messages on the server in addition to downloading them to your computer.</p>
  
<p>For news accounts, expanding the account newsgroups list will automatically
  check for new items, as it will by just selecting one of the newsgroups.
  While reading a newsgroup, you can force checking for new items by clicking
  Get Msgs.</p>

<p>For blogs &amp; feeds accounts, the first time you expand the account, it
  will be checked for new items. Besides that, you can force checking for new
  items at any time by clicking Get Msgs.</p>

<p>You can also set up Mail &amp; Newsgroups to get new messages at startup and
  to check for new messages at timed intervals.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2"><img src="images/task_mail.png" alt=""/></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="width: 20px;"></td>
    <td><strong>Mail &amp; Newsgroups icon</strong></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The Mail &amp; Newsgroups icon on the status bar displays a green arrow to
  notify you when new messages have arrived.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2"><img src="images/task_newmail.png" alt=""/></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="width: 20px;"></td>
    <td><strong>New mail notification</strong></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>To set up a mail account to automatically check for new messages, begin from
  the Mail window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the Edit menu and choose Mail &amp; Newsgroups Account Settings. You
    see the Mail &amp; Newsgroups Account Settings dialog box.</li>
  <li>If you have multiple accounts, select an account and click the Server
    Settings category for that account.</li>
  <li>Select one or both of the following options in the Server Settings
    section:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Check for new mail at startup</strong>: Select this checkbox
        if you want to check this account automatically for new messages
        whenever you start Mail &amp; Newsgroups. For POP accounts, Mail &amp;
        Newsgroups checks for new mail, but doesn&apos;t download new messages
        until you click Get Msgs or unless you choose <q>Automatically download
        any new messages</q>.</li>
      <li><strong>Check for new messages every [__] minutes</strong>: Select
        this checkbox if you want to specify the number of minutes between mail
        checks. You can also check for new messages at any time by clicking Get
        Msgs in the Mail window.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Click OK. Your settings take effect the next time you start
    &brandShortName; Mail &amp; Newsgroups.</li>
</ol>

<p>To set up &brandShortName; Mail &amp; Newsgroups to play a sound or display
  an alert when new mail arrives, see <a
  href="mailnews_preferences.xhtml#notifications">Mail &amp; Newsgroups
  Preferences - Notifications</a>.</p>

<p>You can always retrieve messages manually at any time. To get new messages
  for the selected account or newsgroup, do one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Click Get Msgs on the Mail toolbar.</li>
  <li>Open the File menu (in the Mail window) and choose Get New Messages.</li>
</ul>

<p>To get new messages for all your mail accounts, begin from the Mail
  window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click the triangle on the Get Msgs button in the Mail toolbar.</li>
  <li>Choose Get All New Messages. &brandShortName; Mail &amp; Newsgroups
    retrieves new messages for all your mail accounts.

    <p>If you are not currently logged into one of your mail accounts, Mail
      &amp; Newsgroups first prompts you to enter your user name and password
      before retrieving new messages for that account. (If you have already
      stored your user name and password using the Password Manager, Mail &amp;
      Newsgroups doesn&apos;t prompt you for this information.)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: You can also open the File menu (in the Mail window)
  and choose <q>Get New Messages for</q>.</p>

<p>To get new messages for a specific mail account, begin from the Mail
  window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click the triangle on the Get Msgs button on the Mail toolbar.</li>
  <li>Choose the account for which you want to retrieve mail.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Mail &amp; Newsgroups prompts you for your password
  the first time you retrieve messages for an account. You can choose to have
  Mail &amp; Newsgroups store your password in the Password Manager at that
  time.</p>

<p>Password Manager can save all your user names and passwords on your own
  computer and enter them for you automatically. For more information, see
  <a href="using_priv_help.xhtml#using_the_password_manager">Using the Password
  Manager</a>.</p>

<p>[<a href="#reading_messages">Return to beginning of section</a>]</p>

<h2 id="choosing_how_you_view_the_mail_window">Choosing How You View the Mail
  Window</h2>

<p>You can customize the layout of the Mail window (the window you see when you
  choose Mail &amp; Newsgroups from the Window menu):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Open the View menu and choose Show/Hide to show or hide the Mail toolbar,
    search bar, or the status bar.</li>
  <li>Open the View menu and choose Layout to select the type of three-pane
    window layout to use.</li>
  <li>Expand and collapse any pane to switch between a three-pane or two-pane
    view.</li>
</ul>

<p>[<a href="#reading_messages">Return to beginning of section</a>]</p>

<h2 id="sorting_and_threading_messages">Sorting and Threading Messages</h2>

<p>To sort messages by categories such as subject, sender, date, or priority,
  begin from the Mail window:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Click the appropriate column heading in the message list window. Or, open
    the View menu, choose Sort by, and then select the column you want to sort
    by.</li>
</ul>

<p>To reorder column headings, begin from the Mail window:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Click and drag a column heading to the left or right to reposition the
    column.</li>
</ul>

<p>To change which columns are displayed, begin from the Mail window:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Click the Show/Hide Columns icon <img src="images/columns.png" alt=""/>
    and select the column to be added/removed from the list.</li>
</ul>

<p>To group messages by threading (subject), so each message is grouped with
  all its responses:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Click the thread button to the left of the Subject, Sender, and Date
    column headings. Or, open the View menu, choose Sort by, and then select
    Threaded.</li>
</ul>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2"><img src="images/threadbutton.png" alt=""/></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="width: 20px;"></td>
    <td><strong>Thread button</strong></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: The thread button automatically sorts the threads by
  the age of their parent messages. If you want to use another sort criterion
  for the threads, open the View menu and select the desired option from the
  Sort by submenu.</p>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: Select <q>Preserve threading when sorting messages</q>
  in the <a href="mailnews_preferences.xhtml#mail_and_newsgroups">Mail &amp;
  Newsgroups Preferences</a> if you want &brandShortName; to preserve the
  threaded message grouping when sorting messages with column header clicks. The
  thread button just toggles between threaded and unthreaded message grouping in
  this mode. If <q>Preserve threading when sorting messages</q> is not selected,
  &brandShortName; automatically displays the messages unthreaded when you sort
  them by clicking on a column header.</p>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: To help you identify unread messages in a collapsed
  thread where you&apos;ve read the parent message, &brandShortName; Mail &amp;
  Newsgroups underlines the parent message.</p>

<p>[<a href="#reading_messages">Return to beginning of section</a>]</p>

<h2 id="saving_and_printing_messages">Saving and Printing Messages</h2>

<p>To save a mail message as a plain-text, HTML, or Outlook Express file:</p>

<ol>
  <li>In the Mail window, select the message.</li>
  <li>Open the File menu and choose Save As, and then choose File.</li>
  <li>For <q>Save as type</q>, choose a file type (HTML, Text, or Mail file).
    Choose Mail file if you want to save the message so it can be opened by
    Microsoft Outlook or Outlook Express.</li>
  <li>Change the filename&apos;s extension to end in .html, .txt, or .eml,
    depending on the file type you chose in step 3.</li>
  <li>Choose a destination for the file and click Save.</li>
</ol>

<p>To print a selected message:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Click Print.</li>
</ul>

<p>[<a href="#reading_messages">Return to beginning of section</a>]</p>

<h2 id="controlling_images_scripts_and_plugins">Controlling Images, Scripts,

<h2 id="composing_mail_and_newsgroup_messages">Composing Mail and Newsgroup
  Messages</h2>

<p>You can address, compose, reply to, or send a new message by doing one of
  the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In any &brandShortName; window, open the File menu and choose New, then
    Message.</li>
  <li>Click Compose on the Mail toolbar.</li>
  <li>While displaying a message, click Reply, Forward, or Reply All on the
    Mail toolbar.</li>
  <li>From the Address Book window, select an address and click Compose on the
    Address Book.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: Use the Mail &amp; Newsgroups Account Settings - 
  <a href="mailnews_account_settings.xhtml#addressing">Composition &amp;
  Addressing</a> dialog box to specify the HTML text editor to use for
  composing messages sent from this account. (You can specify a different
  editor for each of your accounts.) See
  <a href="mailnews_getting_started.xhtml#changing_the_settings_for_an_account">Changing
  the Settings for an Account</a> for more information.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: It is generally not possible to compose messages for
  them to be published in blogs &amp; news feeds accounts. If you want to
  publish posts in a blog (and you have the appropiate rights to do it), you
  will need to use the mechanisms provided by the specific blog system. In some
  cases, this can even include sending a mail message to a specific address.</p>

<p>Composing messages in HTML format allows you to use different fonts, text
  styles (such as bold or italic) and text colors, tables, numbered or bulleted
  lists, and pictures in your messages. However, some recipients may only be
  able to read messages composed in plain text format. If you want to use the
  plain-text editor occasionally, you can hold down the Shift key while
  clicking the Compose or the Reply button to use the plain-text editor on an
  as-needed basis.</p>

<p>[<a href="#sending_messages">Return to beginning of section</a>]</p>

<h2 id="using_the_message_composition_window">Using the Message Composition
  Window</h2>

<p>Use the Compose window to address, compose, and send mail and newsgroup
  messages. First specify whether you want to compose messages in plain text or
  HTML by default in the <a
  href="mailnews_account_settings.xhtml#addressing">Composition &amp;
  Addressing</a> Preferences panel (open the Edit menu and choose Mail &amp;
  Newsgroups Account Settings).</p>

<p>To view the Compose window, click the Compose button on the Mail
  toolbar.</p>

<p>The Compose window contains the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mail Toolbar

    <p>You can click the following buttons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Send</strong>: To send a completed message.</li>
      <li><strong>Address</strong>: To search for names in your address
        books.</li>
      <li><strong>Attach</strong>: To attach a file to a message. See
        <a href="#using_attachments">Using Attachments</a> for more
        information.</li>
      <li><strong>Spell</strong>: To check the spelling of your message
        text.</li>
      <li><strong>Security</strong>: To display information about whether
        your message will be sent encrypted or digitally signed (or
        both).</li>
      <li><strong>Save</strong>: To save the message as a draft.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Addressing area: Where you enter the email addresses of recipients.</li>
  <li>Attachments area: When you attach files to a message (by clicking in this
    area or by clicking the Attach button), the filenames will be listed in the
    Attachments area to the right of the Addressing area.</li>
  <li>Message body area: Where you type the contents of your message.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you&apos;ve chosen to compose messages using the HTML editor, you see an
  additional toolbar with text formatting buttons similar to those in
  &brandShortName; Composer.</p>

<p>For help using the HTML editor, see
  <a href="composer_help.xhtml#formatting_your_web_pages">Formatting Your Web
  Pages</a>.</p>

<p>[<a href="#sending_messages">Return to beginning of section</a>]</p>

<h2 id="addressing_a_message">Addressing a Message</h2>

<p>To address a mail message:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Type the name in the addressing area.

    <p>If you have <a
      href="mailnews_preferences.xhtml#address_autocompletion">address
      autocompletion</a> enabled (it&apos;s enabled by default), type the first
      few letters of the recipient&apos;s name and wait for Mail &amp;
      Newsgroups to complete the address. (Or you can type part of the name and
      immediately press <kbd class="mac">Return</kbd><kbd
      class="noMac">Enter</kbd> to have Mail &amp; Newsgroups try to complete
      the address.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>If multiple addresses are displayed, select an address and press
    <kbd class="mac">Return</kbd><kbd class="noMac">Enter</kbd>.

    <p><strong>Note</strong>: Use a comma to separate multiple addresses on the
      same line. Do not use a comma to separate first or last names. For
      example, multiple entries might be:</p>

    <p><tt>user1@netscape.net,user2@netscape.net</tt></p>
  </li>
  <li>If you want this message to be sent from a different account, click the
    <q>From</q> field to select the account you want. See
    <a href="#changing_the_account_from_which_a_message_is_sent">Changing the
    Account From Which a Message is Sent</a> for more information.</li>
  <li>If necessary, click <q>To</q> to choose a different recipient type:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>To</strong>: For primary recipients of your message.</li>
      <li><strong>Cc</strong>: For secondary recipients (carbon copy).</li>
      <li><strong>Bcc</strong>: For secondary recipients not identified to the
        other recipients, including those in the cc list (blind carbon
        copy).</li>
      <li><strong>Reply-To</strong>: For recipients to reply to a different
        email address other than the one the message is sent from.</li>
      <li><strong>Newsgroup</strong>: For posting to a newsgroup.</li>
      <li><strong>Followup-To</strong>: For redirecting a newsgroup posting, so
        that subsequent replies go directly to the redirected newsgroup instead
        of the original newsgroup.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: You can quickly address a message by clicking the
  email address contained in a message you&apos;re reading, and then selecting
  Compose Mail To from the pop-up menu.</p>

<p id="changing_the_account_from_which_a_message_is_sent"><strong>Changing the
  Account From Which a Message is Sent</strong></p>

<p>If you have multiple mail accounts, the account listed in the From field is
  based on the account (or server) you selected when you choose to create a new
  message. However, &brandShortName; Mail &amp; Newsgroups also allows you to
  change the account a message is sent from while you&apos;re composing a
  message. Click the From field to view a list of your accounts and then select
  the account you want. A copy of the message is saved in the Sent folder of
  the account where you sent the message from.</p>

<p><strong>About Address Autocompletion</strong></p>

<p>Address autocompletion allows you to address mail easily from the Compose
  window without having to search for names or type complete names. Mail &amp;
  Newsgroups automatically checks your address books and an
  <a href="glossary.xhtml#ldap">LDAP</a> directory server (if available) and
  completes the name if it finds a unique match. It also prevents mistakes by
  showing all possible choices with additional information if it finds multiple
  matches. Address autocompletion is enabled by default.</p>

<p>If you don&apos;t want to use an address that Mail &amp; Newsgroups
  provides, press Backspace or Delete to remove characters and then enter an
  alternate address.</p>

<p>To disable address autocompletion:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the <span class="mac">&brandShortName;</span>
    <span class="noMac">Edit</span> menu and choose Preferences.</li>
  <li>Under the Mail &amp; Newsgroups category, click Addressing. (If no
    subcategories are visible, double-click Mail &amp; Newsgroups to expand
    the list).</li>
  <li>In the Address Autocompletion section, deselect <q>Local Address
    Books</q> and <q>Directory Server</q>.</li>
  <li>Click OK.</li>
</ol>

<p>[<a href="#sending_messages">Return to beginning of section</a>]</p>

<h2 id="selecting_message_sending_options">Selecting Message Sending
  Options</h2>

<p>While you&apos;re composing a message, you can select these additional
  message sending options from the Options menu:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Select Addresses</strong>: The Select Addresses option lets you
    choose the recipient&apos;s email address from your Address Books or a
    remote directory. To look up an address in an address book or directory,
    enter the first few letters of the recipient&apos;s first or last name to
    start the search. Select an address and then click To:, Cc:, or Bcc: to
    address your message.</li>
  <li><strong>Quote Message</strong>: Choose this option to have the selection
    of the message text shown as quoted text.</li>
  <li><strong>Return Receipt</strong>: Choose this option to request a
    confirmation message when the recipient displays (opens) the message. Keep
    in mind that the recipient may choose not to send you a return receipt.
    This option lets you enable or disable return receipt requests on a
    per-message basis. To automatically request return receipts for all
    messages you send, use the return receipts preferences. See
    <a href="mailnews_preferences.xhtml#return_receipts_preferences">Mail &amp;
    Newsgroups Preferences - Return Receipts</a> for more information.</li>
  <li><strong>Format</strong>: Send the message as plain text, or HTML
    (formatted), or both. If you choose <q>Auto-Detect</q>, Mail &amp;
    Newsgroups prompts you for the format to use if it&apos;s unknown whether
    the recipient&apos;s mail program can display an HTML message. The format
    you choose here overrides the send format you specified using the
    Preferences command on the <span class="mac">&brandShortName;</span>
    <span class="noMac">Edit</span> menu.</li>
  <li><strong>Priority</strong>: Choose a priority to indicate whether the
    message has lowest, low, normal, high, or highest priority.</li>
  <li><strong>Text Encoding</strong>: Choose a text encoding used for this
    message.</li>
  <li><strong>Send a Copy To</strong>: Choose this if you want to file an
    additional copy of the sent message in a different folder than your default
    Sent folder. Then select the folder you want.</li>
  <li><strong>Encrypt This Message</strong>: Choose this to have &brandShortName;
    encrypt this message (without changing the default).</li>
  <li><strong>Digitally Sign This Message</strong>: Choose this to have
    &brandShortName; digitally sign this message (without changing the
    default).</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, the following options are available from the Edit menu:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Rewrap</strong>: If you are composing a message using the
    plain-text editor, you can use the Rewrap command to rewrap long lines of
    quoted text to fit the Compose window. This command rewraps selected quoted
    text to the number of characters specified by the
    <a href="mailnews_preferences.xhtml#composition">Composition</a>
    preferences. This command is primarily useful when you are replying to a
    message where the original message is quoted in your reply, and the original
    message contains long lines.

    <p>You use the Mail &amp; Newsgroups Account Settings command on the Edit
      menu to specify that you want to use the plain-text editor for composing
      messages. Select the Composition &amp; Addressing panel of the account
      and uncheck <q>Compose messages in HTML format</q> to use the plain-text
      editor for all messages. If you only want to use the plain-text editor
      occasionally, you can hold down the Shift key while clicking the Compose
      or the Reply button to use the plain-text editor on an as-needed
      basis.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Check Spelling</strong>: Checks the spelling of the message text
    before you send it. You can also click Spell.</li>
  <li><strong>Spellcheck As You Type</strong>: Choose this option to have the
    spelling of the message text checked as you type.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="confirming_that_your_message_was_opened">Confirming That Your Message
  Was Opened</h2>

<p>You can use return receipts to notify you when a recipient has displayed
  (opened) your message. The recipient must be using a mail program that
  supports the Message Disposition Notification (MDN) standard. Keep in mind
  that the recipient may choose not to send you a return receipt, even if
  you&apos;ve requested one. Messages you send to a newsgroup address will not
  include a return receipt request, since news servers don&apos;t support this
  feature.</p>

<p>To request return receipts for all messages you send, you can use the global
  <a href="mailnews_preferences.xhtml#return_receipts_preferences">Return
  Receipt</a> preferences to specify how to manage requests you receive for
  return receipts. You can override these global preferences for individual
  accounts.</p>

<p>To request a return receipt on a per-message basis:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From a Mail Compose window, open the Options menu, and choose Return
    Receipt.</li>
</ul>

<p>To automatically request return receipts when sending messages from each of
  your mail accounts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the <span class="mac">&brandShortName;</span>
    <span class="noMac">Edit</span> menu and choose Preferences.</li>
  <li>Under the Mail &amp; Newsgroups category, click

  <li>Select <q>When sending messages, always request a return receipt</q>.</li>
  <li>Click OK.</li>

<h2 id="saving_and_editing_a_draft_message">Saving and Editing a Draft
  Message</h2>

<p>To save a mail message as a draft so you can complete it later:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In the Compose window, click Save, or open the File menu and choose Save
    as Draft. By default, the message is saved in the Drafts folder for the
    current account.

    <p><strong>Note</strong>: Your mail message will stay open after you save
      it as a draft.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To edit or send a draft message, begin from the Mail window:</p>

<ol>

    message.</li>
  <li>Click the message that you want to edit.</li>
  <li>In the top-right corner of the message, click the Edit Draft
    button.</li>
  <li>Edit the message as necessary.</li>
  <li>Click Send to send the message or click Save to save the message so you
    can complete it later.

    <p><strong>Note</strong>: Sending the message removes it from the Drafts
      folder.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: You can also double-click the message to open it for
  editing. This is especially useful if the message pane is closed.</p>

<p>To delete one or more unwanted draft messages, begin from the Mail
  window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click the Drafts folder for the account where you created the draft
    messages.</li>

<h2 id="creating_and_using_templates">Creating and Using Templates</h2>

<p>Templates are useful for setting the default format for messages that you
  send regularly, such as weekly status reports. You can save a message as a
  template from any window in which it is displayed, including from within a
  Mail compose window.</p>

<p>To save a message to use as a template:</p>

<ol>
  <li>In the Mail window, click Compose to create a new message and then set
    the default font, text size, text color, background color, and any other
    default formatting you want.

    <p>Alternatively, open an existing message that already has the formatting
      you want.</p>
  </li>
  <li>While displaying the message, open the File menu, choose Save As, then
    choose Template. The message is stored as a template in the Templates
    folder for the current mail account.</li>
</ol>

<p>To compose a message using a template:</p>

<ol>
  <li>In the Mail window, select the Templates folder for the account where you
    created the message template.</li>
  <li>Double-click the message template to open it.</li>
  <li>Edit the message, then save it (to put it in the Drafts folder) or send
    it.

    <p><strong>Note</strong>: Sending the message does not remove the template
      from the Templates folder. The template is preserved for future use.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>To delete one or more unwanted message templates, begin from the Mail
  window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click the Templates folder for the account where you created the message
    templates.</li>
  <li>Select the message templates that you want to delete.</li>
  <li>Click Delete in the Mail toolbar.</li>

<h2 id="using_html_in_your_messages">Using HTML in Your Messages</h2>

<p>HTML messages can include formatted text, links, images, and
  tables&mdash;just like a web page. However, some recipients may not be able
  to receive HTML messages. &brandShortName; Mail &amp; Newsgroups allows you
  to compose mail and newsgroup messages using either the HTML (rich-text)
  formatting editor or the plain-text editor for each mail account you have.
  In addition, you can choose whether your addressees should receive HTML or
  plain-text messages by default, and how Mail &amp; Newsgroups should handle
  messages when it&apos;s not known if an addressee can receive HTML-formatted
  mail.</p>

<p>To specify whether to use the HTML editor as the default for composing
  messages, begin from the Mail window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the Edit menu and choose Mail &amp; Newsgroups Account Settings. You
    see the Mail &amp; Newsgroups Account Settings dialog box.</li>
  <li>Select the mail or newsgroup account you want to use.</li>
  <li>Go to the Composition &amp; Addressing panel and select <q>Compose
    messages in HTML format</q>. You see the Formatting toolbar in the Compose
    window. Leave this box unchecked to use the plain-text editor for this
    account.</li>

<h3 id="editing_or_inserting_html_elements">Editing or Inserting HTML
  Elements</h3>

<p>If you understand how to work with HTML source code, you can edit or insert
  additional HTML tags, style attributes, and JavaScript in your mail message.
  If you are not sure how to work with HTML source code, it&apos;s best not to
  change it. To work with HTML code, use one of these methods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Place the insertion point where you want to insert the HTML code, then
    open the Insert menu and choose HTML. In the Insert HTML dialog box, enter
    HTML tags and text, and then click Insert to insert your changes.</li>
  <li>Select the HTML source code that you want to edit, then open the Insert
    menu and choose HTML. In the Insert HTML dialog box, edit HTML tags and
    text, and then click Insert to insert your changes.</li>
  <li>Select an element such as a table, named anchor, image, link, or
    horizontal line. Double-click the element to open the associated properties
    dialog box for that item. Click Advanced Edit to open the Advanced Property
    Editor. You can use the Advanced Property Editor to add HTML attributes and
    JavaScript to objects.</li>

<h2 id="choosing_html_mail_sending_options">Choosing HTML Mail Sending
  Options</h2>

<p>By default, Mail &amp; Newsgroups prompts you before sending HTML messages
  when it&apos;s not known whether the recipient&apos;s mail program can
  display HTML-formatted messages.</p>

<p>To choose sending-format options for mail messages, begin from the Mail
  window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the <span class="mac">&brandShortName;</span>
    <span class="noMac">Edit</span> menu and choose Preferences.</li>
  <li>Under the Mail &amp; Newsgroups category, click
    <a href="mailnews_preferences.xhtml#send_format">Send Format</a>. (If no
    subcategories are visible, double-click Mail &amp; Newsgroups to expand the
    list).

    <p><strong>Note</strong>: This preference applies only to mail messages,
      not to newsgroup messages.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Select the option you want and then click OK.</li>
</ol>

<p>If while composing a message you realize that one or more recipients may not
  be able to receive HTML-formatted mail, you can easily convert the message to
  a different format when you click Send:</p>

<ol>
  <li>In the Compose window, open the Options menu and choose Format.</li>
  <li>Select the format you want to use for sending the message from the
    submenu:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Auto Detect</strong>: Mail &amp; Newsgroups chooses the
        appropriate format for the message text. If it can&apos;t determine the
        format, it asks you to choose a format.</li>
      <li><strong>Plain Text Only</strong>: The message may not display
        formatting such as bold text, but all mail programs will be able to
        display the message.</li>
      <li><strong>Rich Text (HTML) Only</strong>: Some mail programs may have
        trouble displaying an HTML-formatted message. Choose this option only
        if you are sure the recipient&apos;s mail program can display
        HTML-formatted mail.</li>
      <li><strong>Plain and Rich (HTML) Text</strong>: This uses more disk
        space, but may be the best choice if you are not sure whether the
        recipient&apos;s mail program can display HTML-formatted mail.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>When you&apos;ve finished composing the message, click Send.</li>

    <p>If this recipient can only read messages sent as plain text (no
      formatting), then choose Plain Text. If you don&apos;t know or are not
      sure, choose Unknown.</p>

    <p>If you choose Unknown, &brandShortName; Mail &amp; Newsgroups determines
      the sending format based on the Send Format settings for Mail &amp;
      Newsgroups in the Preferences dialog box. If Mail &amp; Newsgroups still
      can&apos;t determine the correct format, it will prompt you to choose a

  types, Mail &amp; Newsgroups lets you open the attachment using another
  application, or you can save the attachment on your hard disk.</p>

<p>To open the attachment, make sure you have a program on your computer that
  can open files of the same type as the attachment&apos;s file format. For
  example, if you want to open a .DOC file, make sure you have a program on
