# In case you are looking for the note about different declensions on date
# formats, here it is. If your language doesn't use different declensions of
# month names, you shouldn't have much work. Just leave the *.monthFormat
# string on "nominative" and the string month.*.name will be filled in.
#
# If you need a different form for a string, you can change the 
# *.monthFormat to a different value. Supported values are currently:
#    nominative (default), genitive
# The modified month name form will then be filled in accordingly. If this
# system does not suit your needs, please file a bug!

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (month.*.name):
# Some languages require different declensions of month names.
# These values will be used if *.monthFormat is set to "nominative" or in places
# where using a different declension is not yet supported.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (dayOrdinalSymbol):
# Allows to insert a string, a character or a symbol after the number of a
# monthday in order to give it the meaning of ordinal number e.g.  1 -> 1st etc.
# It's mainly used when formatting dates with both monthday and month name. It
# affects the following localizable strings that hence must be localized *without*
# any ordinal symbol for the monthday number:
#   dayHeaderLabel, monthlyDaysOfNth_day,
#   yearlyNthOn, daysIntervalBetweenYears,
#   daysIntervalBetweenMonths, daysIntervalInMonth.
# Write only a single string if the ordinal symbol is the same for every monthday, otherwise
# write a sequence of _31_ strings (one for each monthday) separated with commas.
# If your language doesn't require that in the mentioned strings, leave it empty.
# e.g.
# dayOrdinalSymbol=.
#    -> daysIntervalInMonth: 'March 3. - 9., 2008'
# dayOrdinalSymbol=st,nd,rd,th,th,th,th,th,th,th,th,th,th,th,th,
#                  th,th,th,th,th,st,nd,rd,th,th,th,th,th,th,th,st
#    -> daysIntervalBetweenMonths: 'September 29th - November 1st, 2008'
