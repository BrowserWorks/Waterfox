 This file is used as a persistent data store for helper application
 information about both MIME type and protocol scheme helpers.

 The root of the data are the two containers
 <RDF:Seq about="urn:mimetypes:root"/> and <RDF:Seq about="urn:schemes:root"/>.

 These contain one <RDF:li/> entry per MIME type/protocol.  Each <RDF:li/> entry
 corresponds to a "urn:<class>:<type>" resource, where <class> is either
 "mimetype" or "scheme" and <type> is either a MIME type in "major/minor" format
 or a scheme.  For example, for HTML we would have "urn:mimetype:text/html",
 while for mailto: we would have "urn:scheme:mailto".

 Typically, this resource will be in the <RDF:Description/> node which has the
 corresponding "about" attribute.

 Each "urn:<class>:<type>" resource can have the following properties:

   NC:Value - the MIME type or scheme string
   NC:editable - a "true" or "false" depending on whether this entry is
                 editable
   NC:description - a description of the type ("HTML Document" for text/html)
   NC:fileExtensions - for MIME types, there will be one of these properties
                       per extension that corresponds to this MIME type,
                       each one having a single extension as its value.
   NC:handlerProp - the way the type should be handled.  This corresponds to a
                    "urn:<class>:handler:<type>" resource.  Eg, the way HTML is
                    handled would be stored in the
                    "urn:mimetype:handler:text/html" resource.

 Each "urn:<class>:handler:<type>" resource can have the following properties:

   NC:useSystemDefault - "true" if we should handle per default OS setting,
                          "false" or not set otherwise
   NC:saveToDisk - "true" if the data should be saved to disk, "false" or not
                   set otherwise.
     (Note - if both of these are false, that means "open in helper app")
   NC:alwaysAsk - "true" if the user should always be prompted before handling
                  data of this type, false otherwise.
   NC:externalApplication - the preferred helper application to use for this
                            type.  This corresponds to a
                            "urn:<class>:externalApplication:<type>" resource.
   NC:possibleApplication - a helper application that can be used for this type.
                            Since there can be multiple possible applications,
                            there can be multiple assertions in the graph with
                            this property for a given handler resource.

 Each "urn:<class>:externalApplication:<type>" resource, and each resource
 that represents a possible application, can have the following property:

   NC:prettyName - the "pretty name" of the application ("Acrobat Reader" for
                   /usr/bin/acroread, eg).

 If the resource represents a local application, then it can have the following
 property:

   NC:path - the path to the application on the local filesystem, for example
             /usr/bin/test or C:\windows\system32\cmd.exe.

 If the resource represents a web application, then it can have the following
 property:

   NC:uriTemplate - a URI pointing to the web application to which the type
                    should be handed off, with %s in the template representing
                    the place where the content should be inserted. For example,
                    here is a URI template for a service that lets you email
                    an address in a mailto: link:
                      http://www.example.com/sendmail?link=%s
