Windows Installation Instructions
---------------------------------

Note: For Windows 2000/XP systems, you need Administrator privileges to
install SeaMonkey. If you see an "Error 5" message during installation,
make sure you're running the installation with Administrator privileges.


   To install SeaMonkey by downloading the SeaMonkey installer,
   follow these steps:

   1. Click the link to seamonkey-x.xx.en-US.win32.installer.exe (or
      similar file name) on the website you're downloading SeaMonkey from to
      download the installer file to your machine.

   2. Navigate to where you downloaded the file and double-click the
      installer file icon on your machine to begin the Setup program.

      .zip file to your machine.

      compressed file.

      Note: This step assumes you already have a recent version of WinZip
