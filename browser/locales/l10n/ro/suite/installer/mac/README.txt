  Where Information is Stored
  ---------------------------

  When you run SeaMonkey for the first time, a "SeaMonkey" folder is created in

  ~/Library/Application Support/ (where ~ is your home directory).

  Your personal settings, bookmarks, e-mail, passwords etc. are stored in a
  profile folder inside the SeaMonkey folder. The profile folder is located at

  ~/Library/Application Support/SeaMonkey/Profiles/[randomString.profileName].

  SeaMonkey stores its cache in ~/Library/Cache/SeaMonkey. Certain settings
  (like the last root folder used by the Save dialog) are stored in

  ~/Library/Preferences/org.mozilla.seamonkey.plist.


  Uninstallation
  --------------

  To uninstall SeaMonkey (but keep your personal settings, bookmarks etc.),
  simply drag the SeaMonkey icon from your Applications folder to the Trash.

  To completely remove all traces of SeaMonkey from your computer
  (including your personal settings, bookmarks, e-mail, passwords etc.),
  follow these steps:

  1. Drag the SeaMonkey icon from your Applications folder to the Trash

  2. Drag the ~/Library/Application Support/SeaMonkey folder to the Trash

  3. Drag the ~/Library/Cache/SeaMonkey folder to the Trash
