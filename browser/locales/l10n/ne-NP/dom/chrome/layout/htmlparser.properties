# Encoding warnings and errors
EncNoDeclarationFrame=The character encoding of a framed document was not declared. The document may appear different if viewed without the document framing it.
EncNoDeclarationPlain=The character encoding of the plain text document was not declared. The document will render with garbled text in some browser configurations if the document contains characters from outside the US-ASCII range. The character encoding of the file needs to be declared in the transfer protocol or file needs to use a byte order mark as an encoding signature.
EncNoDeclaration=The character encoding of the HTML document was not declared. The document will render with garbled text in some browser configurations if the document contains characters from outside the US-ASCII range. The character encoding of the page must be declared in the document or in the transfer protocol.
EncLateMetaFrame=The character encoding declaration of the framed HTML document was not found when prescanning the first 1024 bytes of the file. When viewed without the document framing it, the page will reload automatically. The encoding declaration needs to be moved to be within the first 1024 bytes of the file.
EncLateMeta=The character encoding declaration of the HTML document was not found when prescanning the first 1024 bytes of the file. When viewed in a differently-configured browser, this page will reload automatically. The encoding declaration needs to be moved to be within the first 1024 bytes of the file.
EncLateMetaReload=The page was reloaded, because the character encoding declaration of the HTML document was not found when prescanning the first 1024 bytes of the file. The encoding declaration needs to be moved to be within the first 1024 bytes of the file.
EncLateMetaTooLate=The character encoding declaration of document was found too late for it to take effect. The encoding declaration needs to be moved to be within the first 1024 bytes of the file.
EncMetaUnsupported=An unsupported character encoding was declared for the HTML document using a meta tag. The declaration was ignored.
EncProtocolUnsupported=An unsupported character encoding was declared on the transfer protocol level. The declaration was ignored.
EncBomlessUtf16=Detected UTF-16-encoded Basic Latin-only text without a byte order mark and without a transfer protocol-level declaration. Encoding this content in UTF-16 is inefficient and the character encoding should have been declared in any case.
EncMetaUtf16=A meta tag was used to declare the character encoding as UTF-16. This was interpreted as an UTF-8 declaration instead.
EncMetaUserDefined=A meta tag was used to declare the character encoding as x-user-defined. This was interpreted as a windows-1252 declaration instead for compatibility with intentionally mis-encoded legacy fonts. This site should migrate to Unicode.
