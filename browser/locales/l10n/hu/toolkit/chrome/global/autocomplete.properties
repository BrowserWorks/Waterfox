# LOCALIZATION NOTE (searchWithEngine, searchInPrivateWindowWithEngine): %S will
# be replaced with the search engine provider's name. This format was chosen
# because the provider can also end with "Search" (e.g.: MSN Search).

searchInPrivateWindowWithEngine = %S keresés egy privát ablakban

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (searchInPrivateWindow): Used when the private browsing
# engine is the same as the default engine.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (switchToTab2): This is the same as the older switchToTab
# string that it's replacing, except it uses title case, so "Switch" and "Tab"
# are capitalized.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (visit): This is shown next to autocomplete entries that are
# simple URLs or sites, which will be visited when the user selects them.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (bookmarkKeywordSearch): This is the title of autocomplete

# search text that the user is typing.  %2$S will not be empty.
