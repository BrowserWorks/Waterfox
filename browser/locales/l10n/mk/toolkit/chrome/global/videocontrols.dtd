<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (positionAndDuration.nameFormat): the #1 string is the current
media position, and the #2 string is the total duration. For example, when at
the 5 minute mark in a 6 hour long video, #1 would be "5:00" and #2 would be
"6:00:00", result string would be "5:00 / 6:00:00".
Note that #2 is not always available. For example, when at the 5 minute mark in an
unknown duration video, #1 would be "5:00" and the string which is surrounded by
<span> would be deleted, result string would be "5:00".
