<h2 id="server_settings">Mail &amp; Newsgroups Account Settings - Server
  Settings</h2>

<p>&brandShortName; Mail &amp; Newsgroups can work with two types of mail
  servers: IMAP and POP. If you are not sure which server type your Internet
  service provider supports, ask your service provider. If your Internet
  service provider supports both, the following descriptions may help you
  choose which one to use.</p>

  section</a>]</p>

<h3 id="about_internet_message_access_protocol">About Internet Message Access
  Protocol (IMAP)</h3>

<p><strong>Advantages</strong>: Your messages and any changes to them stay on
  your server, saving local disk space. Also, you always have access to an
  updated mailbox, and you can get your mail from multiple locations.
  Performance on a modem is faster, since you initially download message
  headers only.</p>

<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong>: Not all ISPs support IMAP.</p>

<p>[<a href="#mail_and_newsgroups_account_settings">Return to beginning of
  section</a>]</p>

<h3 id="about_post_office_protocol">About Post Office Protocol (POP)</h3>

<p><strong>Advantages</strong>: Your messages are downloaded to your local
  computer all at once, but you can also specify whether to keep copies of the
  messages on the server and delete messages on the server when they are
  deleted locally. Most ISPs currently support POP.</p>

<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong>: If you use more than one computer, messages
  might reside on one or the other, but not both. POP doesn&apos;t work as well
  as IMAP over a slow link connection. Also, you can&apos;t access all mail
  folders from multiple locations.</p>

<p>Note that more recent POP servers have features that allow retrieving only
  the headers instead of the full message, like IMAP allows. Using these
  features allows performance with POP to be nearly as fast as with IMAP.</p>

<p>[<a href="#mail_and_newsgroups_account_settings">Return to beginning of
  section</a>]</p>

<h3 id="imap_server_settings">IMAP Server Settings</h3>

<p>If you are not already viewing the IMAP server settings, begin from the Mail
  window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the Edit menu and choose Mail &amp; Newsgroups Account Settings. You
    see the Mail &amp; Newsgroups Account Settings dialog box.</li>
  <li>Select the account name and click the Server Settings category. (If you
    chose an IMAP server when you set up this account, you see your IMAP server
    settings.)</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Server Type</strong>: The server type (IMAP Mail Server) that you
    specified when you created this account. To change the server type
    associated with this account, you must delete the account and then
    re-create it.</li>
  <li><strong>Server Name</strong>: The server name that you specified when you
    created this account. If you are having problems getting mail from this
    account, verify with your service provider or system administrator that the
    server name you entered is correct.</li>
  <li><strong>User Name</strong>: The user name that you specified when you
    created this account.</li>
  <li><strong>Port</strong>: Unless otherwise instructed to do so by your
    service provider or system administrator, leave this setting
    unchanged.</li>
  <li><strong>Connection security</strong>: Choose one of the available options
    to establish a <a href="glossary.xhtml#secure_connection">secure
    connection</a> to your incoming IMAP server. You can choose one of these:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>None</strong>: &brandShortName; will use a plain connection,
        without encryption at all. You should choose this <em>only</em> if your
        incoming server allows password encryption or doesn&apos;t support any
        type of security.</li>
      <li><strong>STARTTLS</strong>: Require an encrypted connection, use the
        <a href="glossary.xhtml#starttls">STARTTLS</a> method. This mechanism
        will usually run on the standard IMAP port 143.</li>
      <li><strong>SSL/TLS</strong>: Require an encrypted connection, use the
        IMAP-over-SSL method. The default port for this is 993.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Authentication method</strong>: Choose one of the available
    options to use <a href="glossary.xhtml#secure_authentication">secure
    authentication</a> with your incoming IMAP server. You can choose one of
    these:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Normal password</strong>: &brandShortName; will send your
        password as clear text, without encryption at all. This option is
        safe when SSL/TLS or STARTTLS is used.</li>
      <li><strong>Password, transmitted insecurely</strong>: Same as
        <q>Normal password</q> but only available when a connection security
        of <q>None</q> is selected and hence is unsafe. Do <em>not</em> choose
        this unless your incoming server doesn&apos;t support any type of
        security at all.</li>
      <li><strong>Encrypted password</strong>: Require the encryption of the
        user&apos;s credentials as supported by the server, such as
        <a href="glossary.xhtml#cram_md5">CRAM-MD5</a>. This option is safe
        to use even if the connection security setting is <q>None</q>, but
        only the password would be secured in this way, not any content.</li>
      <li><strong>Kerberos / GSSAPI</strong>: Choose this option if your
        computer is set up for secure authentication using
        <a href="glossary.xhtml#kerberos">Kerberos</a>. You may need to
        acquire a Kerberos ticket by using a separate program, or it may be
        assigned to you when logging into your computer.</li>
      <li><strong>NTLM</strong>: Choose this option if your computer is set up
        for secure authentication using an <a href="glossary.xhtml#ntlm">NT
        LAN Manager</a>. In general, Kerberos should be preferred over NTLM as
        it provides for a higher level of security.</li>
      <li><strong>TLS Certificate</strong>: Choose this option to use
        <a href="glossary.xhtml#certificate-based_authentication">certificate-based
        authentication</a> on a connection with SSL/TLS or STARTTLS enabled,
        without the need to provide any password for authentication.</li>
    </ul>
    If you are unsure which options are supported by your server, contact your
    service provider or system administrator.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Check for new messages at startup</strong>: Choose this setting
    if you want Mail &amp; Newsgroups to automatically check this account for
    new messages whenever you start Mail &amp; Newsgroups.</li>
  <li><strong>Check for new messages every [__] minutes</strong>: Choose this
    setting to automatically check for new messages, and then specify the
    number of minutes between mail checks. If you do not select this setting,
    you can check for new messages at any time by clicking Get Msgs in the Mail
    window.</li>
  <li><strong>Allow immediate server notifications when new messages
    arrive</strong>: Choose this setting if the server supports IMAP&apos;s
    <q>IDLE</q> capability to immediately notify &brandShortName; when new
    mail arrives. This option does not have any effect for servers which
    don&apos;t support this capability. It can be used in addition to, or
    instead of, any of the other options to check for mail.</li>
  <li id="when_i_delete_a_message"><strong>When I delete a message</strong>:
    Choose the behavior you want for deleted messages. <q>Move it to this
    folder</q>, where you can choose the specific folder to use, is recommended
    unless you are instructed to use a different setting by your system
    administrator or service provider. Messages marked as deleted are removed
    only when you compact folders.</li>
  <li><strong>Clean up (Expunge) Inbox on Exit</strong>: Removes deleted
    messages from the Inbox when you exit Mail &amp; Newsgroups. Choose this
    if you chose to mark messages as deleted.</li>
  <li><strong>Empty Trash on Exit</strong>: Empties the Trash folder whenever
    you quit Mail &amp; Newsgroups.</li>
  <li><strong>Advanced</strong>: Lets you choose a different outgoing server
    (SMTP) for outgoing messages from this account. You can also reach the
    <a href="#advanced_imap_server_settings">Advanced IMAP Server Settings</a>
    through this button.</li>
  <li><strong>Local directory</strong>: The location on your hard disk where
    mail for this account is stored.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="advanced_imap_server_settings">Advanced IMAP Server Settings</h3>

<p>In most cases, advanced IMAP server settings are automatically supplied by
  the server. If you are unsure about the settings for this dialog box,
  contact your ISP or system administrator.</p>

<p>If you are not already viewing the advanced IMAP server settings, begin
  from the Mail window.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the Edit menu and choose Mail &amp; Newsgroups Account Settings. You
    see the Mail &amp; Newsgroups Account Settings dialog box.</li>
  <li>Select the account name and click the Server Settings category.</li>
  <li>If the mail server type is an IMAP server, you can click Advanced to set
    additional IMAP options, such as:
    <ul>
      <li>the IMAP server directory path</li>
      <li>showing only <q>subscribed folders</q></li>
      <li>support for subfolders</li>
      <li>the maximum number of concurrent connections kept open to the server

  <a href="mailnews_security.xhtml">Signing &amp; Encrypting
  Messages</a>.</p>

<p>If you are not already viewing the Security settings for your mail account,
  begin from the Mail window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the Edit menu and choose Mail &amp; Newsgroups Account
    Settings.</li>
  <li>Click Security under the name of the mail account whose security settings
    you want to configure.</li>

  </ul>
</div>

<h3 id="about_certificates">About Certificates</h3>

<p>The main purpose of the Security panel in Mail &amp; Newsgroups Account
  Settings is to select two certificates:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The email certificate you want to use for signing mail messages you send
    to other people.</li>
  <li>The email certificate you want other people to use when they encrypt
    messages they send to you.</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on the policies of the
  <a href="glossary.xhtml#certificate_authority">certificate authority (CA)</a>
  that issues your certificate(s), you can use one certificate for both
  purposes or two different certificates. Even if you use just one, you must
  specify it twice, once for digital signing and once for encryption.</p>

<p>The certificates you select here are included with every signed message you
  send. These certificates allow your recipients to verify your digital
  signature and to encrypt messages that they send to you.</p>

<h3 id="digital_signing">Digital Signing</h3>

<p>You use the Digital Signing area in the <a href="#security">Security
  panel</a> to specify how you want to sign your email messages:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Use this certificate to digitally sign messages you
    send</strong>: If this field is empty or if it displays the wrong
    certificate, click Select to choose from the certificates you have on
    file.</li>
  <li><strong>Digitally sign messages</strong>: Select this checkbox if you
    want to digitally sign all the messages you send. (A personal certificate
    must be specified below before you can select this checkbox.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Regardless of whether the <q>Digitally sign messages</q> checkbox is
  selected here, you can change your mind before you send an individual
  message.</p>

<p>To change the digital signature setting for a message you are writing in
  the Compose window, click the arrow below the Security icon near the top of
  the window and select or deselect <q>Digital Sign This Message</q>. For
  details, see <a
  href="mailnews_security.xhtml#signing_and_encrypting_a_new_message">Signing
  &amp; Encrypting a New Message.</a></p>

<h3 id="encryption">Encryption</h3>

<p>You use the Encryption area in the <a href="#security">Security panel</a> to
  specify how you routinely want to use encryption when sending your
  messages:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Use this certificate to encrypt &amp; decrypt messages sent to
    you</strong>: If this field is empty or if it displays the wrong
    certificate, click Select to choose from the certificates you have on
    file.</li>
  <li><strong>Never</strong>: Select this option if you never want to use
    encryption, or only occasionally.</li>
  <li><strong>Required</strong>: Select this option if you always want to use
    encryption. If you don&apos;t have all the necessary certificates, the
    message won&apos;t be sent unless you explicitly turn off encryption for
    that message only.</li>
</ul>

<p>Regardless of which encryption option you select, you can change your mind
  before you send an individual message.</p>

<p>To change the encryption setting for a message you are writing in the
  Compose window, click the arrow below the Security icon near the top of the
  window and choose the encryption setting you want. For details, see <a

<h2 id="outgoing_server">Mail &amp; Newsgroups Account Settings - Outgoing
  Server (SMTP)</h2>

<p>The outgoing server will transport your outgoing mail to the intended
  recipients.</p>

<p>If you are not already viewing the Outgoing Server (SMTP) settings, begin
  from the Mail window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click on any Mail window.</li>
  <li>From the Edit menu, choose Mail &amp; Newsgroups Account Settings.</li>
  <li>Select Outgoing Server (SMTP) and either edit an existing server or
      add a new one. If you are not sure which option to choose, check with
      your ISP or system administrator)<br/>
      You can choose from these servers via the Outgoing Server dropdown in
      the <a href="#account_settings">Identity Settings</a>.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Description</strong>: A short freetext description of that server
    configuration. This will show up as first part in the server list.</li>
  <li><strong>Server name</strong>: The SMTP server that will deliver your
    outgoing mail. To use a different SMTP server, change this field.</li>
  <li><strong>Port</strong>: The port on which the SMTP server will be
    connected. By default it holds the standard port for the specified
    encryption. Change it if the mail server is listening for connections
    on a non-standard port.</li>
  <li><strong>Connection security</strong>: Choose one of the available options
    to establish a <a href="glossary.xhtml#secure_connection">secure
    connection</a> to your outgoing SMTP server. You can choose one of these:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>None</strong>: &brandShortName; will use a plain connection,
        without encryption at all. You should choose this <em>only</em> if your
        outgoing server allows password encryption, doesn&apos;t support any
        type of security at all, or if no authentication is required to send
        messages.</li>
      <li><strong>STARTTLS</strong>: Require an encrypted connection, use the
        <a href="glossary.xhtml#starttls">STARTTLS</a> method. This mechanism
        will usually run on the standard SMTP-submission port 587 or the
        generic port 25.</li>
      <li><strong>SSL/TLS</strong>: Require an encrypted connection, use the
        SMTP-over-SSL (also known as SMTPS) method. The default port for this
        is 465.</li>
    </ul>
    If you make a choice for which your server is not configured, you will
    get an error message when sending mail.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Authentication method</strong>: Choose one of the available
    options to use <a href="glossary.xhtml#secure_authentication">secure
    authentication</a> with your incoming SMTP server. You can choose one of
    these:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No authentication</strong>: Neither a user name nor a
        password will be sent to the server. This option may be chosen if
        the SMTP server is in a local network or if other means are provided
        to authenticate the user, such as <q>POP before SMTP</q>.</li>
      <li><strong>Normal password</strong>: &brandShortName; will send your
        password as clear text, without encryption at all. This option is
        safe when SSL/TLS or STARTTLS is used.</li>
      <li><strong>Password, transmitted insecurely</strong>: Same as
        <q>Normal password</q> but only available when a connection security
        of <q>None</q> is selected and hence is unsafe. Do <em>not</em> choose
        this unless your outgoing server doesn&apos;t support any type of
        security at all.</li>
      <li><strong>Encrypted password</strong>: Require the encryption of the
        user&apos;s credentials as supported by the server, such as
        <a href="glossary.xhtml#cram_md5">CRAM-MD5</a>. This option is safe
        to use even if the connection security setting is <q>None</q>, but
        only the password would be secured in this way, not any content.</li>
      <li><strong>Kerberos / GSSAPI</strong>: Choose this option if your
        computer is set up for secure authentication using
        <a href="glossary.xhtml#kerberos">Kerberos</a>. You may need to
        acquire a Kerberos ticket by using a separate program, or it may be
        assigned to you when logging into your computer.</li>
      <li><strong>NTLM</strong>: Choose this option if your computer is set up
        for secure authentication using an <a href="glossary.xhtml#ntlm">NT
        LAN Manager</a>. In general, Kerberos should be preferred over NTLM as
        it provides for a higher level of security.</li>
    </ul>
    If you are unsure which options are supported by your server, contact your
    service provider or system administrator.
  </li>
  <li><strong>User Name</strong>: The user name that you specified when you
    created this account. Not available if <q>No authentication</q> is
    selected.</li>
</ul>
