<!-- Thread Pane Column Picker -->
<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (columnPicker.resetToInbox.label):
     This option in the thread pane column picker causes us to reset the
     customizations for the thread pane columns in this folder to their default.
  -->
<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (columnPicker.applyTo.label):
     This option in the thread pane column picker pops up a sub-menu containing
     the "columnPicker.applyToFolder.label" and
     "columnPicker.applyToFolderAndChildren.label" options. This item indicates
     a desire to apply the currently displayed set of columns to some other
     folder(s). The sub-menu items indicate whether we want to apply it to just
     a folder or also its children.
  -->
<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (columnPicker.applyToFolder.label):
     This option in the thread pane column picker is found on a sub-menu beneath
     the "columnPicker.applyTo.label" alongside
     "columnPicker.applyToFolderAndChildren.label". It indicates a desire to
     apply the currently display thread pane column settings to a single folder
     that the user selects using the same widget as the move to/copy to
     mechanism (via a series of popups).
  -->
<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (columnPicker.applyToFolderAndChildren.label):
     This option in the thread pane column picker is found on a sub-menu beneath
     the "columnPicker.applyTo.label" alongside
     "columnPicker.applyToFolder.label". It indicates a desire to
     apply the currently display thread pane column settings to a folder and all
     of its descendents. The user selects the folder using the same widget as the
     move to/copy to mechanism (via a series of popups).
  -->
<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (columnPicker.thisFolder.label):
     This is used in the folder selection widget for the
     "columnPicker.applyToFolder.label" and
     "columnPicker.applyToFolderAndChildren.label" menu options. Whenever
     a folder has children, it results in a menu popup; the first menu item
     in that popup is given this label to indicate that that folder should be
     selected. For example, if folder "A" has two children, "B" and "C", then
     when the user hovers over "A", a new popup menu will be displayed whose
     items are "This folder", "B", and "C". This is the equivalent of the
     "File here" option for the move to/copy to widget.

<!-- Quick Search Bar -->
<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (quickSearchCmd.key):
     This is actually the key used for the global message search box; we have
     not changed
  -->
<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (search.label.base1):
      This is the base of the empty text for the global search box. We replace
     #1 with the contents of the appropriate search.keyLabel.* value for the
     platform.
     The goal is to convey to the user that typing in the box will allow them
     to search for messages globally and that there is a hotkey they can press
     to get to the box faster. If the global indexer is disabled, the search
     box will be collapsed and the user will never see this message.
  -->
<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (search.keyLabel.nonmac):
     The description of the key-binding to get into the global search box on
     windows and linux (which use the control key). We use the key defined in
     the quickSearchCmd.key entity defined above, the letter should match it.
  -->
<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (search.keyLabel.mac):
     The description of the key-binding to get into the global search box on mac
     systems. We use the key defined in the quickSearchCmd.key entity defined
     above, the letter should match it.
