<h1 id="managing_profiles">Managing Profiles</h1>

<p>If you use the Internet at home and at work, you may want to have access to
  a different set of bookmarks, preferences, address books, email accounts,
  Sidebar setup, and so on. Similarly, family members may want to share a copy
  of the same browser software but keep their Internet identities separate.</p>

<p>The Profile Manager lets you create different profiles, each with its own
  bookmarks, preferences, email settings, and so on. You automatically create a
  default profile when you first install your browser software. After you
  create one or more additional profiles, you will be asked which you want to
  use each time you launch the browser.</p>

        with its stored data (bookmarks, preferences, email
        accounts, and so on). <em>Make sure that you won&apos;t need anything
        from the profile in the future before you choose this option.</em></li>

        the list of available profiles, but keeps the profile folder. By
        choosing this option none of your profile&apos;s stored data will be
        deleted.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
