<p>This package provides SAX Tree: a tree model optimized for creation from SAX 
events and replay as SAX events.</p>
<h2>Design Principles</h2>
<ol>
<li>Preserve information exposed through <code>ContentHandler</code>, 
<code>LexicalHandler</code> <em>and</em> <code>Locator</code>.
<li>Creation from SAX events or as part of the parse of a conforming 
HTML5 document should be <em>fast</em>.</li>
<li>Emitting SAX events based on the tree should be <em>fast</em>.</li>
<li>Mutations should be <em>possible</em> but should not make the above 
"fast" cases slower.</li>
<li>Concurrent reads should work without locking when there are no 
concurrent mutations.</li>
<li>The user of the API has the responsibility of using the API properly: 
for the sake of performance, the model does not check if it is being 
used properly. Improper use may, therefore, put the model in and 
inconsistent state.</li>
</ol>
