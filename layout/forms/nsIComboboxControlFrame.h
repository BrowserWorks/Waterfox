   * When the dropdown is dropped down via a mouse click and the user moves the mouse
   * up and down without clicking, the currently selected item is being tracking inside
   * the dropdown, but the combobox is not being updated. When the user selects items
   * with the arrow keys, the combobox is being updated. So when the user clicks outside
   * the dropdown and it needs to roll up it has to decide whether to keep the current
   * selection or not. This method is used to get the current index in the combobox to
   * compare it to the current index in the dropdown to see if the combox has been updated
   * and that way it knows whether to "cancel" the current selection residing in the
   * dropdown. Or whether to leave the selection alone.
