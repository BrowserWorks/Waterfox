  /* Overflow containers are continuation frames that hold overflow. They
   * are created when the frame runs out of computed height, but still has
   * too much content to fit in the availableHeight. The parent creates a
   * continuation as usual, but marks it as NS_FRAME_IS_OVERFLOW_CONTAINER
   * and adds it to its next-in-flow's overflow container list, either by
   * adding it directly or by putting it in its own excess overflow containers
   * list (to be drained by the next-in-flow when it calls
   * ReflowOverflowContainerChildren). The parent continues reflow as if
   * the frame was complete once it ran out of computed height, but returns a
   * reflow status with either IsIncomplete() or IsOverflowIncomplete() equal
   * to true to request a next-in-flow. The parent's next-in-flow is then
   * responsible for calling ReflowOverflowContainerChildren to (drain and)
   * reflow these overflow continuations. Overflow containers do not affect
   * other frames' size or position during reflow (but do affect their
   * parent's overflow area).
   *
   * Overflow container continuations are different from normal continuations
   * in that
   *   - more than one child of the frame can have its next-in-flow broken
   *     off and pushed into the frame's next-in-flow
   *   - new continuations may need to be spliced into the middle of the list
   *     or deleted continuations slipped out
   *     e.g. A, B, C are all fixed-size containers on one page, all have
   *      overflow beyond availableHeight, and content is dynamically added
   *      and removed from B
   * As a result, it is not possible to simply prepend the new continuations
   * to the old list as with the overflowProperty mechanism. To avoid
   * complicated list splicing, the code assumes only one overflow containers
   * list exists for a given frame: either its own overflowContainersProperty
   * or its prev-in-flow's excessOverflowContainersProperty, not both.
   *
   * The nsOverflowContinuationTracker helper class should be used for tracking
   * overflow containers and adding them to the appropriate list.
   * See nsBlockFrame::Reflow for a sample implementation.

 * A frame is related to two sets of overflow containers: those that /are/

 * This tracker walks through those continuations (the frame's NIF's children)
 * and their prev-in-flows (a subset of the frame's normal and overflow
 * container children) in parallel. It allows the reflower to synchronously
 * walk its overflow continuations while it loops through and reflows its
 * children. This makes it possible to insert new continuations at the correct
 * place in the overflow containers list.
 *
 * The reflower is expected to loop through its children in the same order it
 * looped through them the last time (if there was a last time).
 * For each child, the reflower should either
 *   - call Skip for the child if was not reflowed in this pass
 *   - call Insert for the overflow continuation if the child was reflowed
 *     but has incomplete overflow
 *   - call Finished for the child if it was reflowed in this pass but
 *     is either complete or has a normal next-in-flow. This call can
 *     be skipped if the child did not previously have an overflow
 *     continuation.
