Proxy for using W3C WebDriver-compatible clients to interact with
Gecko-based browsers.

This program provides the HTTP API described by the `WebDriver protocol`_.
to communicate with Gecko browsers, such as Firefox.  It translates calls
into the `Firefox remote protocol`_ by acting as a proxy between the local-
and remote ends.

You can consult the `change log`_ for a record of all notable changes
to the program.  Releases_ are made available on GitHub.
