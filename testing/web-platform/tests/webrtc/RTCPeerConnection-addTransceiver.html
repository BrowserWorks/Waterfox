        several times simultaneously.

    TODO
      5.1.  addTransceiver
        Adding a transceiver will cause future calls to createOffer to add a media
        description for the corresponding transceiver, as defined in [JSEP]
        (section 5.2.2.).

        The sendEncodings argument can be used to specify the number of offered
        simulcast encodings, and optionally their RIDs and encoding parameters.
        Aside from rid , all read-only parameters in the RTCRtpEncodingParameters
        dictionaries, such as ssrc , must be left unset, or an error will be thrown.

        1.  If the dictionary argument is present, and it has a streams member, let
            streams be that list of MediaStream objects.
        2.  If the dictionary argument is present, and it has a sendEncodings member,
            let sendEncodings be that list of RTCRtpEncodingParameters objects.
        5.  Verify that each rid value in sendEncodings is composed only of
            case-sensitive alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) up to a
            maximum of 16 characters. If one of the RIDs does not meet these
            requirements, throw a TypeError.
        6.  If any RTCRtpEncodingParameters dictionary in sendEncodings contains
            a read-only parameter other than rid, throw an InvalidAccessError.
        7.  If sendEncodings is set, then subsequent calls to createOffer will be
            configured to send multiple RTP encodings as defined in [JSEP]
            (section 5.2.2. and section 5.2.1.). When setRemoteDescription is called
            with a corresponding remote description that is able to receive multiple
            RTP encodings as defined in [JSEP] (section 3.7.), the RTCRtpSender may
            send multiple RTP encodings and the parameters retrieved via the
            transceiver's sender.getParameters() will reflect the encodings
            negotiated.
        8.  This specification does not define how to configure createOffer to
            receive multiple RTP encodings. However when setRemoteDescription is
            called with a corresponding remote description that is able to send
            multiple RTP encodings as defined in [JSEP], the RTCRtpReceiver may
            receive multiple RTP encodings and the parameters retrieved via the
            transceiver's receiver.getParameters() will reflect the encodings
            negotiated.
      5.3.  RTCRtpReceiver Interface
        Create an RTCRtpReceiver
        4.  If an id string, id, was given as input to this algorithm, initialize
            track.id to id. (Otherwise the value generated when track was created
            will be used.)

    Non-testable
      5.2.  RTCRtpSender Interface
        create an RTCRtpSender
          3.  Let sender have an [[associated MediaStreams]] internal slot,
              representing a list of MediaStream objects that the MediaStreamTrack
              object of this sender is associated with.
          4.  Set sender's [[associated MediaStreams]] slot to streams.
          5.  Let sender have a [[send encodings]] internal slot, representing a
              list of RTCRtpEncodingParameters dictionaries.
          6.  If sendEncodings is given as input to this algorithm, and is non-empty,
              set the [[send encodings]] slot to sendEncodings. Otherwise, set it
              to a list containing a single RTCRtpEncodingParameters with active
              set to true.

        11. Update the negotiation-needed flag for connection.
