# Tentative tests for performance.measureMemory API

Tests in this directory are for the proposed performance.measureMemory API.
This is not yet standardised and browsers should not be expected to pass
these tests.

See the explainer at https://github.com/WICG/performance-measure-memory
for more information about the API.
