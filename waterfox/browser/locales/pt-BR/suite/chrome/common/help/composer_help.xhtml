<h1 id="creating_web_pages_with_mozilla_composer">Creating Web Pages with
  &brandShortName; Composer</h1>

<p>&brandShortName; Composer lets you create your own web pages and publish
  them on the web. You don&apos;t have to know HTML to use Composer; it is as
  easy to use as a word processor.</p>

<p>Toolbar buttons let you add lists, tables, images, links to other pages,
  colors, and font styles. You can see what your document will look like on
  the Web as you create it, and you can easily share your document with
  other users, no matter what type of browser or HTML-capable email program
  they use.</p>

<p>To start using &brandShortName; Composer:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Click the Composer icon in the lower-left corner of any
    &brandShortName; window.</li>
</ul>

<div><img src="images/composer_icon.png" width="128" height="23"

<h2 id="creating_a_new_page">Creating a New Page</h2>

<p>&brandShortName; Composer is an HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) editor that
  allows you to create and edit web pages. Composer is a <em>WYSIWYG</em> (What
  You See Is What You Get) editor, so you can display how your page will look
  to the reader as you&apos;re creating it. It is not necessary for you to know
  HTML, since most of the basic HTML functions are available as commands from
  the toolbars and menus.</p>

<p>Composer also lets you edit the HTML source if you want. To view or edit the
  HTML source code, open the View menu, and choose HTML Source, or click the
  &lt;HTML&gt; Source tab in the Edit Mode toolbar at the bottom of the
  Composer window.</p>

<p>To create a web page, use one of the methods described below. Once
  you&apos;ve started a page, you can add and edit text just as you would
  in a word processor.</p>

<p><strong>To create a new page from the browser</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Open the File menu, choose New, and then Composer Page. A Composer
    window containing a blank page opens.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>To edit a page you&apos;re currently viewing in the
  browser</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In the browser window of the page you&apos;re viewing, open the File
    menu and choose Edit Page. You see a Composer window that contains the
    page you&apos;re viewing.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>To create a new page in Composer</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Click the New button in Composer&apos;s toolbar.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>To start from an HTML file stored on your local drive</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the Window menu and choose Composer. You see the Composer
    window.</li>
  <li>Open the File menu and choose Open File. You see the Open HTML File
    dialog box.</li>
  <li>On your local drive, locate the file that you want to edit.</li>
  <li>Click Open to display the specified file in a Composer window.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>To edit a web page</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the Window menu and choose Browser.</li>
  <li>Go to a web page: type the URL of the page (for example,
    <tt>http://www.mozilla.org</tt>) in the Location Bar and press
    <kbd class="mac">Return</kbd><kbd class="noMac">Enter</kbd>.</li>
  <li>Open the File menu and choose Edit Page.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: In the Composer window you can quickly open the most
  recent file you&apos;ve been working on by opening the File menu, choosing
  Recent Pages, and then selecting the file you want from the list.</p>

<p>[<a href="#starting_a_new_page">Return to beginning of section</a>]</p>

<h2 id="saving_and_browsing_your_new_page">Saving and Browsing Your New
  Page</h2>

<p>You can save Composer documents in HTML or text-only format. Saving a
  document in HTML format preserves the document&apos;s formatting, such
  as text styles (for example, bold or italic), tables, links, and images.
  Saving a document in text-only format removes all the HTML tags but
  preserves the document&apos;s text.</p>

<p>To save a document as an HTML file:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Open the File menu and choose Save or click the Save button on the
    Composition toolbar.

    <p>If you haven&apos;t already given your page a title, Composer prompts
      you to do so. Composer displays the page title in the browser
      window&apos;s title bar when you view the page in the browser. The
      document&apos;s page title also appears in your list of bookmarks
      if you bookmark the page.</p>

    <p>Composer then prompts you to enter a filename and specify the location
      where you want to save the file. Make sure you preserve the .html
      extension in the filename.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To change the filename or location of an existing HTML file:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Choose Save As and select a different filename or location.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you save a page in Composer, all parts of the page (the HTML, images
  and other files, such as sound files and style sheets), are saved locally
  on your hard drive. If you only want to save the HTML part of the page, you
  must change the Composer preference for saving pages. See
  <a href="#composer">Composer Preferences - Composer</a> for more information
  on changing Composer&apos;s setting for saving pages.</p>

<p>If an image location is absolute (starts with <q>http://</q>) and you are
  connected to the Internet, you will still see that image in the document in
  Composer and the browser. However, if the image location is relative to the
  page location (starts with <q>file:///</q>), then you won&apos;t see the
  image in the local version of the document.</p>

<p>To save a document as a text-only file:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the File menu and choose Export to Text.</li>
  <li>Enter the filename and specify the location where you want to save the
    file.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Images do not appear in documents saved in the
  text-only format.</p>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: You can choose Revert to Last Saved from the File
  menu to retrieve the most recently saved copy of the document in which
  you&apos;re working. Keep in mind that your current changes will be lost.</p>

<p>To view your page in a browser window in order to test your links:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Open the File menu and choose Browse Page (or click Browse in the
    Composition toolbar). If you have not yet saved your document, Composer
    prompts you to enter a page title, filename, and location. The Composer
    window remains open behind the new browser window.</li>

<h2 id="formatting_paragraphs_headings_and_lists">Formatting Paragraphs,
  Headings, and Lists</h2>

<p>To apply a format to a paragraph, begin from the Composer window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click to place the insertion point where you want the format to begin,
    or select the text you want to format.</li>
  <li>Choose a paragraph format using the drop-down list in the Format toolbar:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Body Text</strong>: Applies the application default font and
        style for regular text, without affecting the spacing before or after
        the text.</li>
      <li><strong>Paragraph</strong>: Inserts a paragraph tag (use this to
        begin a new paragraph). The paragraph includes top and bottom
        margins.</li>
      <li><strong>Heading 1</strong> - <strong>Heading 6</strong>: Formats the
        paragraph as a heading. Heading 1 is the highest-level heading, while
        Heading 6 is the lowest-level heading.</li>
      <li><strong>Address</strong>: Can be used for a web page <q>signature</q>
        that indicates the author of the page and the person to contact for
        more information, for example: <tt>user@example.com</tt> 

        <p>You might want to include the date and a copyright notice. This
          format usually appears at the bottom of the web page under a
          horizontal line. The browser displays the address format in
          italics.</p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Preformat</strong>: This is useful for elements such as code
        examples, column data, and mail messages that you want displayed in a
        fixed-width font. In normal text, most browsers remove extra spaces,
        tabs, and paragraph returns. However, text that uses the Preformatted
        style is displayed with the white space intact, preserving the layout
        of the original text.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>To format text as a heading:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click to place the insertion point anywhere within the text that you
    want to format.</li>
  <li>Using the drop-down list in the Format toolbar, choose the level of
    heading you want, from 1 (largest) to 6 (smallest). Choose <q>Heading 1</q>
    for your main heading, <q>Heading 2</q> for the next level, and so
    forth.</li>
</ol>

<p>To apply a list item format:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click to place the insertion point within the line of text that you want
    to format.</li>
  <li>Open the Format menu and choose List.</li>
  <li>Choose the list style:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Bulleted</strong>: Each item has a bullet (dot) next to it
        (as in this list).</li>
      <li><strong>Numbered</strong>: Items are numbered.</li>
      <li><strong>Term</strong> and <strong>Definition</strong>: These two
        styles work together, creating a glossary-style appearance. Use the
        Term tag for the word being defined, and the Definition tag for the
        definition. The Term text appears flush left, and the Definition
        text appears indented.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: You can quickly apply a list style to a block of
  text by selecting the text and clicking the Numbered List
  <img src="images/numbers.gif" width="21" height="21" alt="" />
  or Bulleted List
  <img src="images/bullets.gif" width="20" height="20" alt="" />
  buttons on the Format toolbar.</p>

<p>To change the style of bullets or numbers:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click to place the insertion point within the text of the list item you
    want to change, or select one or more items in the list if you want to
    apply a new style to the entire list.</li>
  <li>Open the Format menu and choose List Properties.</li>
  <li>Select a bullet or number style from the drop-down list. For numbered
    lists, you can specify a starting number. For bulleted lists, you can
    change the bullet style.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: You can also double-click on a bullet or number in a
  list to display the List Properties dialog box.</p>

<p>To align a paragraph or text in your page, for example, centering or
  aligning to the left or right:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click to place the insertion point within the paragraph or line of text
    you want to align.</li>
  <li>Open the Format menu and choose Align; then choose an alignment
    option.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: You can also use the Format toolbar to align
  text.</p>

  <li>Type the text you want to indent.</li>
  <li>Press <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd class="mac">Return</kbd><kbd
    class="noMac">Enter</kbd> to create another indented paragraph, or press
    <kbd class="mac">Return</kbd><kbd class="noMac">Enter</kbd> to create the
    next list item.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: You can increase or decrease the indentation of list
  items by clicking anywhere in a list item and then clicking the Indent or
  Outdent button on the Format toolbar. Alternatively, click anywhere in a
  list item and press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to indent one level. Press
  <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> to outdent one level.</p>

<p>To merge two adjacent lists:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the two lists that you want to merge. Be sure to select all of
    the elements in both lists. Note that any text in between the two lists
    will also become part of the merged list.</li>
  <li>Click the bulleted or numbered list button in the Format toolbar to
    merge the lists.</li>

<h2 id="changing_text_color_style_and_font">Changing Text Color, Style, and
  Font</h2>

<p>To change the style, color, or font of selected text:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the text you want to format.</li>
  <li>Open the Format menu and choose one of the following:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Font</strong>: Use this to choose a font. If you prefer to
        use fonts specified by the reader&apos;s browser, select Variable
        Width or Fixed Width.

        <p><strong>Note</strong>: Not all fonts installed on your computer
          appear. Instead of specifying a font that may not be available to all
          who view your web page, it&apos;s generally best to select one of the
          fonts provided in the menu since these fonts work on every computer.
          For example, the fonts Helvetica, Arial, Times, and Courier generally
          look the same when viewed on different computers. If you select a
          different font, it may not look the same when viewed using a
          different computer.</p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Size</strong>: Use this to choose a <em>relative</em> font
        size or select an option to increase or decrease text size (relative
        to the surrounding text).</li>
      <li><strong>Text Style</strong>: Use this to select a style, such as
        italic, bold, or underline, or to apply a structured style, for
        example, Code.</li>
      <li><strong>Text Color</strong>: Use this to choose a color from the
        color picker. If you are familiar with HTML hexadecimal color codes,
        you can type a specific code or you can just type a color name (for
        example, <q>blue</q>). You&apos;ll find the official W3C list of CSS
        supported color names
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#color-units">here</a>,
        and another list of commonly supported color names 
        <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_colornames.asp">here</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>To change the background color of the page:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click anywhere in the page.</li>
  <li>Click the background color block in the Format toolbar.</li>
  <li>Choose a background color from the Block Background Color dialog
    box.</li>
  <li>Click OK.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: To quickly change the color of text to the color
  last used, select the text, then press Shift and click on the text color
  block in the Format toolbar. This is useful when you want to use one
  color for separate lines of text.</p>

<p>You can also use an image as a background. See

<h2 id="inserting_html_elements_and_attributes">Inserting HTML Elements and
  Attributes</h2>

<p>If you understand how to work with HTML source code, you can insert
  additional tags, style attributes, and JavaScript into your page. If you are
  not sure how to work with HTML source code, it&apos;s best not to change it.
  To work with HTML code, use one of these methods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Place the insertion point where you want to insert the HTML code, or
    select the text you want to edit, and then open the Insert menu and choose
    HTML. In the Insert HTML dialog box, enter HTML tags and text, and then
    click Insert.</li>
  <li>Select an element such as a table, named anchor, image, link, or
    horizontal line. Double-click the element to open the associated properties
    dialog box for that item. Click Advanced Edit to open the Advanced Property
    Editor. You can use the Advanced Property Editor to add HTML attributes,
    JavaScript, and CSS to objects.</li>
  <li>Open the View menu, and choose HTML Source, or click the &lt;HTML&gt;
    Source tab in the Edit Mode toolbar at the bottom of the Composer window.
    (If you don&apos;t see the Edit Mode toolbar, open the View menu and choose
    Show/Hide; then make sure the Edit Mode Toolbar is checked.)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="using_the_advanced_property_editor">Using the Advanced Property
  Editor</h3>

<p>To add HTML attributes and JavaScript to objects such as tables, images,
  and horizontal lines, you can use the Advanced Property Editor.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Unless you clearly understand how to add, delete, or
  modify HTML attributes and their associated values, it&apos;s best not to do
  so.</p>

<p>If you are not currently viewing the Advanced Property Editor dialog box,
  follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>From the View menu (or the Edit Mode toolbar), choose HTML Tags.</li>
  <li>Double-click the object that you want to modify to open its Properties
    dialog box.</li>
  <li>Click Advanced Edit to open the object&apos;s Advanced Property Editor.
    The Advanced Property Editor has three tabs, each of which lists the
    current properties for the selected object:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>HTML Attributes</strong>: Click this tab to view or enter
        additional HTML attributes.</li>
      <li><strong>Inline Style</strong>: Click this tab to view or enter
        additional CSS (cascading style sheet) properties through the
        &lt;style&gt; attribute. For more information on using CSS styles
        in Composer, see
        <a href="#composer">Composer Preferences -Composer</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>JavaScript Events</strong>: Click this tab to view or enter
        JavaScript events.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>To edit a property or attribute in any of the three lists, select the
    attribute you want to edit. You can then edit the attribute&apos;s name
    or value using the editable Attribute and Value fields at the bottom of
    the dialog box. To add a new attribute, type it in the Attribute field
    at the bottom of the dialog box. The new attribute is automatically added
    when you click in the Value field. To remove an attribute, select it in
    the list, and click Remove Attribute.

    <p><strong>Note</strong>: Required attributes are highlighted in the
      Attribute list.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Click OK to apply your changes to the Advanced Property Editor dialog
    box.</li>
  <li>Click OK again to exit the Properties dialog box.</li>
</ol>

<p>Composer automatically places quotation marks around any attribute text.</p>

<h2 id="validating_the_html">Validating the HTML</h2>

<p>Before you put your document on a web server so that others can see it, you
  should first check the document&apos;s HTML formatting to make sure it
  conforms to web standards. Documents containing validated HTML are less
  likely to cause problems when viewed by different browsers. Just visually
  checking your web pages in the browser doesn&apos;t ensure that your document
  will appear correctly when viewed in other web browsers.</p>

<p>Composer provides a convenient way for you to check that your document
  conforms to W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) HTML standards. Composer uses
  the W3C HTML Validation Service, which checks your document&apos;s HTML
  syntax for compliance with HTML 4.01 standards. This service also provides
  information on how to correct errors.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: You must be connected to the Internet to use this
  feature.</p>

<p>To validate your document&apos;s HTML syntax:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the Tools menu, and choose Validate HTML. If you have unsaved
    changes, Composer asks you to save them before proceeding.</li>
  <li>When the W3C HTML Validation Service page appears, click Browse and
    locate the file on your hard disk that you want to validate.</li>
  <li>Click <q>Validate this document</q>.</li>
</ol>

<p>[<a href="#formatting_your_web_pages">Return to beginning of
  section</a>]</p>

<h2 id="choosing_the_right_editing_mode">Choosing the Right Editing Mode</h2>

<p>Typically, you won&apos;t need to change the editing mode from the default
  (Normal). However, if you want to work with the document&apos;s HTML source
  code, you may want to change editing modes.</p>

<p>Composer allows you to quickly switch between four editing modes or views.
  Each editing mode allows you to continue working on your document, but
  displays varying levels of HTML tags (and tag icons).</p>

<p>Before you choose an editing mode:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Open the View menu, choose Show/Hide, and then make sure there is a
    checkmark next to Edit Mode Toolbar.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Edit Mode toolbar has four tabs:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Normal</strong>: Choose this editing mode to see how the document
    will look online while you are creating it. Choose this mode to
    show table borders and named anchor icons. All other HTML tag icons
    are hidden.</li>
  <li><strong>HTML Tags</strong>: Choose this mode to show all HTML tag
    icons.</li>
  <li><strong>&lt;HTML&gt; Source</strong>: Choose this mode to view and edit
    the document as unformatted HTML source code. When you save the
    document, the Normal mode reappears.</li>
  <li><strong>Preview</strong>: Choose this mode to display and edit the
    document exactly as it would appear in a browser window, except
    that links and JavaScript functions will not be active.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: JavaScript functions, frames, links, Java,
  embedded objects and animated GIF files are not active in any of
  the editing modes. To display these items in their active
  state, click the Browse button on the Composition toolbar to
  load the page into a browser window.</p>

<h2 id="adding_and_deleting_rows_columns_and_cells">Adding and Deleting Rows,
  Columns, and Cells</h2>

<p>Composer allows you to quickly add or delete one or more cells, columns,
  or rows in a table. In addition, you can set options that allow you to
  maintain the original rectangular structure or layout of the table while
  you perform editing tasks.</p>

<p>To add a cell, row, or column to your table:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click inside the table where you want to add a cell (or cells).</li>
  <li>Open the Table menu and then choose Insert.</li>
  <li>Choose one of the cell groupings. (You can also insert a new table
    within a table cell.)</li>
</ol>

<p>To delete a cell, row, or column:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click a row, column, or cell to place the insertion point. Or,
    select neighboring cells to delete more than one row at a time. To
    select neighboring cells, drag over the cells you want to select.
    To select individual cells in a table, hold down the
    <kbd class="mac">Cmd</kbd><kbd class="noMac">Ctrl</kbd> key and click
    on the cells you want to select.</li>
  <li>Open the Table menu and choose Delete.</li>
  <li>Choose the item you want to delete.</li>
</ol>

<p>To join (or merge) a cell with the cell on its right:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Click inside the cell on the left, open the Table menu, and
    choose Join with Cell to the Right.</li>
</ul>

<p>To join (or merge) adjacent cells:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Select adjacent cells by dragging over them.</li>
  <li>Open the Table menu, and choose Join Selected Cells.</li>
</ul>

<p>To split a joined cell back into two or more cells:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Click inside the joined cell, open the Table menu, and then
    choose Split Cell. Composer puts the entire contents of the joined
    cell into the first of the two cells.</li>
</ul>

<p>Refer to <a href="#selecting_table_elements">Selecting Table Elements</a>
  for information on how to select non-adjacent cells, rows, and
  columns.</p>

<h3 id="changing_the_default_table_editing_behavior">Changing the Default Table
  Editing Behavior</h3>

<p>By default, when you delete one or more cells, Composer preserves the
  table&apos;s structure by adding cells at the end of a row, wherever
  needed. This allows you to delete one or more cells but still maintain
  the table&apos;s original rectangular layout, or structure. Otherwise,
  deleting cells can result in a table with empty spaces, or whose outline
  appears irregular due to an uneven number of cells.</p>

<p>To change the default table editing behavior, begin from the Composer
  window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the Edit menu, choose Preferences, and then choose Composer.</li>
  <li>Under Table Editing, set the following preference:
    <ul>
      <li>Make sure that <q>Maintain table layout when inserting or
        deleting cells</q> is checked to ensure that you don&apos;t get an
        irregularly shaped table.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Click OK.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="selecting_table_elements">Selecting Table Elements</h2>

<p>You can use one of two ways to quickly select a table, cell, or group of
  cells:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Click in the table, open the Table menu, choose Select, and then choose
    an item from the submenu. For example, to select a table, click anywhere
    inside the table, open the Table menu, choose Select, and then choose
    Table.</li>
  <li>Or, you can use the mouse as a selection tool:
    <ul>
      <li>To select a group of adjacent cells: click in a cell, and then
        drag to select the cells you want. Drag the mouse left or right to
        select a row; up or down to select a column.</li>
      <li>To select non-adjacent cells: press <kbd class="mac">Cmd</kbd>
        <kbd class="noMac">Ctrl</kbd> and then click inside a cell. Keep
        pressing <kbd class="mac">Cmd</kbd> <kbd class="noMac">Ctrl</kbd>
        as you click to select additional cells.</li>
      <li>To extend a selection to include adjacent cells: click inside a
        cell and then drag over additional cells to extend the selection.</li>
      <li>To select one or more adjacent columns or rows: drag up or down
        to select the first column or row, and then drag left or right to
        select additional adjacent columns or rows. Press <kbd>Shift</kbd>
        and drag to the right to select an entire row. Press <kbd>Shift</kbd>

    the separator for columns, choose whether or not you want Composer to
    ignore multiple space and treat them as one space.</li>
  <li>Leave <q>Delete separator character</q> checked to have Composer remove
    the separator character when it converts the text into a table. If you
    don&apos;t want Composer to delete the separator character, uncheck this

<p>You can insert GIF, JPEG, BMP, and PNG (Portable Network Graphics) images
  into your web page. You can also use them to
  <a href="#using_images_as_links">create links</a>. When you insert an image,
  Composer saves a reference to the image in your page.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you plan to publish your pages to the web,
  it&apos;s best not to use BMP images in your pages.</p>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: It&apos;s best to first save or publish your page
  before you insert images into it. This allows Composer to automatically
  use relative references to images once you insert them.</p>

<p>To insert an image:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click to place the insertion point where you want the image to
    appear.</li>
  <li>Click the Image button

  <li>Type the location and filename of the image file, or click Choose File
    to search for an image file on your hard drive or network.</li>
  <li>Type a simple description of your image as the alternate text that will
    appear in text-only browsers (as well as other browsers) when an image is

<h2 id="editing_image_properties">Editing Image Properties</h2>

<p>Once you&apos;ve inserted an image into your page, you can edit its
  properties and customize the layout in your page, such as the height,
  width, spacing, and text alignment. If you are not currently viewing
  the Image Properties dialog box, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Double-click the image, or select it and click the Image button
    <img src="images/image.gif" width="23" height="25" alt="" /> on the toolbar
    to display the Image Properties dialog box.</li>
  <li>Click the Location tab to edit these properties:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Image Location</strong>: Type the filename and location of
        the image file. Click Choose File to search for an image file on your
        hard drive or network.</li>
      <li><strong>URL is relative to page location</strong>: If checked,
        Composer converts the URL to be relative to the page&apos;s location.
        This is especially useful if you plan to publish your pages on a web
        server so that others can view them. Using relative URLs allows you
        to keep all your linked files in the same place relative to each other,
        regardless of their location on your hard disk or a web server.

        <p>Unchecking this box causes Composer to convert the URL to a full
          (absolute) URL. You typically use absolute URLs when linking to
          images on other web servers (not stored locally on your hard
          disk).</p>

        <p>If you have never saved or published the page, you must first save
          the page in order to enable this checkbox. (This checkbox is not
          available if you open the Image Properties dialog box in a message
          compose window.)</p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Attach this image to the message</strong>: If checked,
        the image is attached to the message you are sending. If unchecked, a
        link to the image location is inserted instead. (This checkbox is only
        available if you open the Image Properties dialog box in a message
        compose window.)</li>
      <li><strong>Alternate Text</strong>: Enter text that will display in
        place of the original image; for example, a caption or a brief
        description of the image. It&apos;s a good practice to specify
        alternate text for readers who use text-only web browsers or who have
        image loading turned off.</li>
      <li><strong>Don&apos;t use alternate text</strong>: Choose this option
        if the image does not require alternate text or if you don&apos;t want
        to include it.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Click the Dimensions tab to edit these properties:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Actual Size</strong>: Select this option to undo any changes
        you&apos;ve made to the dimensions and return the image to its original
        size.</li>
      <li><strong>Custom Size</strong>: Select this option and specify the new
        height and width, in pixels or as a percentage. This setting
        doesn&apos;t affect the original image file, just the image inserted

      <li><strong>Constrain</strong>: If you change the image size, it&apos;s
        a good idea to select this in order to maintain the image&apos;s aspect
        ratio (so that it doesn&apos;t appear distorted). If you choose this
        option, then you only need to change the height or width, but not
        both.</li>

  <li>Click the Appearance Tab to edit these properties:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Spacing</strong>: Specify the amount of space surrounding
        the image; between the image and adjoining text. You can also put a
        solid black border around the image and specify its width in pixels.
        Specify zero for no border.</li>
      <li><strong>Align Text to Image</strong>: If you&apos;ve placed your
        image next to any text, select an alignment icon to indicate how you
        want text positioned relative to the image.</li>
      <li><strong>Image Map</strong>: Click Remove to remove any image map
        settings.</li>

      <li><strong>Enter a web page location</strong>: If you want to define
        a link for this image, enter the URL of a remote or local page, or
        select a named anchor or heading from the drop-down list. Click Choose
        File to search for a file on your hard drive or network.</li>
      <li><strong>URL is relative to page location</strong>: If checked,
        Composer converts the URL to be relative to the page&apos;s location.
        This is especially useful if you plan to publish your pages to a web
        server so that others can view them. Using relative URLs allows you to
        keep all your linked files in the same place relative to each other,
        regardless of their location on your hard disk or a web server.

        <p>Unchecking this box causes Composer to convert the URL to a full
          (absolute) URL. You typically use absolute URLs when linking to files
          on other web servers (not stored locally on your hard disk).</p>

        <p>If you have unsaved changes, you must first save the page in order
          to enable this checkbox. (This checkbox is not available if you open
          the Image Properties dialog box in a message compose window.)</p>

<h2 id="creating_links_within_the_same_page">Creating Links Within the Same
  Page</h2>

<p>To create a link within the same page, for example a link that the reader
  can use to jump from one section to another, you must create an
  <em>anchor</em> (target location), and then create a link that points to the
  anchor. Anchors are also called <em>named anchors</em>. To create an anchor,
  follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click to place the insertion point at the beginning of a line where you
    want to create an anchor, or select some text.</li>
  <li>Open the Insert menu and choose Named Anchor. You see the Named Anchor
    Properties dialog box.</li>
  <li>Type a unique name for the anchor in the Anchor Name field (up to 30
    characters). If you include spaces, they will be converted to underscores
    ( _ ). If you selected some text in step 1, this box already contains a
    name.</li>
  <li>Click OK. An anchor icon appears in your document to mark the
    anchor&apos;s location:
    <img src="images/anchor-in-doc.gif" width="20" height="17" alt="" /></li>
</ol>

<p>To create the link on which readers can click to jump to the object:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the text or image that you want to link to the anchor.</li>
  <li>Click the Link button or open the Insert menu and choose Link. You see
    the Link Properties dialog box.
    <ul>
      <li>If you&apos;re creating a link to an HTML file on your computer,
        click Choose File to locate it.</li>
      <li>If you&apos;re creating a link to a named anchor (target), select
        it from the list of the anchors currently available in the page.</li>
      <li>If you&apos;re creating a link to a level heading (for example,
        Heading 1 - Heading 6), select it from the list of headings currently
        available in the page.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Click OK.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: To test the link you just created, open the File
  menu and choose Browse Page, then click the link.</p>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: If you did not first create named anchors, you can
  use the Link dialog box to create links to headings that already occur in
  the page.</p>

<p>[<a href="#creating_links_in_composer">Return to beginning of
  section</a>]</p>

<h2 id="creating_links_to_other_pages">Creating Links to Other Pages</h2>

<p>You can create links from your page to local pages on your own computer or
  on your workplace&apos;s network, or to remote pages on the Internet.</p>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: It&apos;s best to first save or publish your page
  before you create links to other pages. This allows Composer to automatically
  use relative references for links once you create them.</p>

<p>To create a link to another page:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click to place the insertion point where you want to create a link, or
    select the text or image that you want to link to the anchor.</li>
  <li>Click the Link button. You see the Link Properties dialog box.</li>
  <li>Define your link:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Link text</strong>: If you&apos;ve already selected an image
        file or text before clicking the Link button, the selected text or
        file will be entered here. Otherwise, you must enter the text that you
        want to use as the link.</li>
      <li><strong>Link Location</strong>: Type the local path and filename or
        remote URL of the page you want to link to. If you&apos;re not sure of
        the path and filename for a local file, click Choose File to look for
        it on your hard disk or network. For remote URLs, you can copy the URL
        from the browser&apos;s Location Bar. Alternatively, you can select a
        named anchor or a heading in the current page that you want to link
        to.</li>
      <li><strong>URL is relative to page location</strong>: If checked,
        Composer converts the URL to be relative to the page&apos;s location.
        This is especially useful if you plan to publish your pages to a web
        server so that others can view them. Using relative URLs allows you to
        keep all your linked files in the same place relative to each other,
        regardless of their location on your hard disk or a web server.

        <p>Deselecting this option causes Composer to convert the URL to a full
          (absolute) URL. You typically use absolute URLs when linking to pages
          on other web servers (not stored locally on your hard disk).</p>

        <p>If you have unsaved changes, you must first save the page in order
          to enable this checkbox. (This checkbox is not available if you open
          the Link Properties dialog box in a message compose window.)</p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Attach the source of this link to the message</strong>: If
        checked, the source of the specified link is added as an attachment to
        the message you are sending. If unchecked, just a link to the location
        is inserted instead. (This checkbox is only available if you open the
        Link Properties dialog box in a message compose window.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>To apply additional attributes or JavaScript events, click Advanced Edit
    to display the
    <a href="#using_the_advanced_property_editor">Advanced Property Editor</a>.
  </li>
  <li>Click OK.</li>
  <li>To test the link you just created, click the Browse button and then click
    the link to make sure it works as expected.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: You can copy a link quickly by clicking and dragging
  the link from another window and then dropping it onto your page. For
  example, you can click and drag a link from a web page, bookmark, or Mail
  window and drop it onto your page. You can also right-click<span class="mac">
  or, if you have a one-button mouse, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-click</span> a link on a
  web page and choose Copy Link Location from the menu. Then you can paste the
  link location into the Link Location field in the Link Properties dialog
  box.</p>

<p>[<a href="#creating_links_in_composer">Return to beginning of
  section</a>]</p>

<h2 id="using_images_as_links">Using Images as Links</h2>

<p>You can make images, such as JPEG, GIF, or PNG files, behave like links in
  your pages. When the reader clicks a linked image, the browser window
  displays the page that the image is linked to.</p>

<p>To make an image behaving like a link:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select an image on your page.</li>
  <li>Click the Link button
    <img src="images/link.gif" width="22" height="20" alt="" />
    on the toolbar, or open the Insert menu and choose Link.</li>
  <li>Use the Link Properties dialog box to link the image to a
    <a href="#creating_links_within_the_same_page">named anchor or heading
    within the page</a>, or to a
    <a href="#creating_links_to_other_pages">separate local or remote page</a>.
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: Drag and drop a linked image from the browser window
  into a Composer window to copy both the image and the link.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: To remove the blue border on images used as links,
  open the Link Properties dialog box, click the Link tab, and uncheck <q>Show
  border around linked image</q>.</p>

<p>To remove a link:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the linked text (normally blue and underlined) or image.</li>
  <li>Open the Format menu and choose Remove Links.</li>
</ol>

<p>To discontinue a link, so that text you type after the link is not included
  as part of the link:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click to place the insertion point where you want the link to end.</li>
  <li>Open the Format menu and choose Discontinue Link.</li>

<p>If your pages exist only on your local hard disk, you can browse your pages,
  but no one else can. Composer lets you publish your pages to a remote
  computer called a web server.</p>

<p>When you publish your pages to a web server, Composer copies (uploads) your
  pages to a computer that lets others browse your pages. Most ISPs provide
  space on their web servers for web page publishing. To find a web server
  where you can publish your pages, ask your ISP, help desk, or system
  administrator.</p>

<h2 id="publishing_a_document">Publishing a Document</h2>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: It&apos;s best to first save or publish your page
  before you insert links or images into it. This allows Composer to
  automatically use relative references for links and images once you insert
  them.</p>

<p>To publish a document:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the HTML document that you want to publish, or create a new Composer
    document.</li>
  <li>When you&apos;re ready to publish the document remotely, click the
    Publish button.

    <p>If you have published this document before, Composer remembers the
      document&apos;s publishing settings and starts publishing the document.
      While publishing is in progress, Composer displays a publishing status
      dialog box.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If you have never published this document before, Composer displays
        the Settings tab in the Publish Page dialog box so you can enter
        information about the document&apos;s remote publishing location. See
        <a href="#publish_page_settings">Publish Page - Settings</a> for more
        information. When you&apos;re done entering information, click Publish.
      </li>
      <li>If you have never saved the document, Composer displays the Publish
        tab in the Publish Page dialog box, so you can enter the
        document&apos;s filename. See
        <a href="#publish_page_publish">Publish Page - Publish</a> for more
        information. After entering the filename, click Publish.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>To browse your published page, click the Browse button. Test the
    page&apos;s links and make sure there are no missing images.</li>
  <li>Continue editing the page as necessary. When you&apos;re ready to update
    the remote page with your changes, click the Publish button.</li>
</ol>

<p>When you publish a document for the first time, Composer changes the
  document&apos;s <tt>file:///</tt> URL to an <tt>http://</tt> URL to indicate
  that you are now editing the published document. If you want to save the
  document locally (on your computer&apos;s hard disk), click the Save button.
  You&apos;ll be prompted to choose a filename and location on your hard disk
  for the document.</p>

<h3 id="tips_for_avoiding_broken_links_or_missing_images">Tips for Avoiding
  Broken Links or Missing Images</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Make sure your Composer filenames end with the .html or .htm file
    extension. Make sure your image filenames end with the .JPG, .GIF, or .PNG
    file extension. Don&apos;t use spaces or other special symbols in your
    filenames. Keep your filenames short and only use lowercase or uppercase
    letters and numbers.</li>
  <li>If your images appear as broken links when you browse a document on the
    web server, you may have forgotten to include the images when you
    published. Open the File menu, and choose Publish As to display the Publish
    Page dialog box. In the Publish tab, make sure you check <q>Include images
    and other files</q> and then click Publish.</li>

<h2 id="updating_a_published_document">Updating a Published Document</h2>

<p>To update a published document:</p>

<ol>
  <li>In a Composer window, open the File menu, and choose Recent Pages, then
    select the document from the list. <p>Alternatively, browse to the location
    of the document you want to update by entering the document&apos;s HTTP
    address (the document&apos;s web address) in the browser&apos;s
    Location Bar.</p></li>
  <li>Edit the document as necessary.</li>
  <li>When you&apos;re ready to update the remote page with your changes, click
    Publish in Composer&apos;s toolbar.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: To delete a page or image you&apos;ve published on a
  web server, you must use an <a href="glossary.xhtml#ftp">FTP (File Transfer
  Protocol)</a> program. You also must use an FTP program if you want to create
  subdirectories or to rename files on the web server. Ask your service
  provider if they recommend a particular FTP program. You can usually find
  information on FTP programs in the Help or Support sections of your service
  provider&apos;s website. FTP programs are also available from shareware sites
  such as ZDNet Downloads.</p>

  <li>From the Site Name list, choose the publishing location you want to use.
    To set up a new publishing location, click New Site. See
    <a href="#publish_page_settings">Publish Page - Settings</a> for more
    information.</li>
  <li>Click Publish to save the document to the new location.</li>

<h2 id="creating_a_new_publishing_site">Creating a New Publishing Site</h2>

<p>If you plan to publish documents to more than one remote location, you can
  set up Composer to save the publishing information for each remote site you
  use, so that you don&apos;t have to enter it each time you want to
  publish.</p>

<p>To create a new publishing site, begin from a Composer window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the Edit menu and choose Publishing Site Settings. Composer
    displays the Publish Settings dialog box.</li>
  <li>Click New Site.</li>
  <li>For <q>Site Name</q>, enter the nickname by which you want to refer to
    this publishing site. 

    <p>For example, if you will use the new site to publish documents
      related to the <q>Meteor</q> project, you might want to use the site
      name <q>Meteor</q>. Site names remind you about the types of documents
      you publish at each site.</p>
  </li>
  <li>For <q>Publishing address</q>, enter the complete URL provided to
    you by your ISP, system administrator, or web hosting service. This
    URL must begin with either <tt>ftp://</tt> or <tt>http://</tt>. 

    <p>The publishing address specifies the location where documents are
      published (uploaded) at this site. If you are not sure what to enter,
      ask your ISP or system administrator.</p>
  </li>
  <li>For <q>HTTP address of your home page</q>, enter the complete URL
    that you would enter in the browser to view pages at this
    site. Do not include a filename or subdirectory as part of the URL.

    <p>This URL must always begin with <tt>http://</tt>. In some cases,
      this URL is the same as the publishing address. If you are not sure
      what to enter, ask your ISP or system administrator, or else leave
      it blank.</p>
  </li>
  <li>For <q>user name</q>, enter the user name you use to log in to your ISP
    or web hosting service.</li>
  <li>For <q>password</q>, enter the password for your user name.</li>
  <li>Select <q>Save Password</q> to save your password securely using
    Password Manager so that you don&apos;t have to enter it each time you
    publish pages at this site.</li>
  <li>Click OK.</li>

<p>If you have set up more than one publishing site, but you typically use
  only one site for most of your publishing needs, you can designate the site
  you use most often as the default publishing site. Composer will use the
  default publishing site for all documents that you publish, unless you
  specifically choose an alternate site.</p>

<p>Regardless of how many sites you&apos;ve set up, you can always publish a
  document to a different site by choosing Publish As from Composer&apos;s
  File menu. See
  <a href="#changing_the_filename_or_publishing_location">Changing the Filename
  or Publishing Location</a> for more information.</p>

<p>To choose the default publishing site, begin from a Composer
  window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the Edit menu, and choose Publishing Site Settings.
    Composer displays the Publish Settings dialog box.</li>
  <li>Select a publishing site from the list. 

    <p>If you only have one publishing site set up, Composer uses that
      one as the default site.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Click Set as Default.</li>
  <li>Click OK to confirm your changes.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="deleting_a_publishing_site">Deleting a Publishing Site</h2>

<p>Deleting a publishing site removes the site&apos;s settings from Composer.
  If you later wish to publish to the site, you must re-enter the site&apos;s
  settings.</p>

<p>To delete a publishing site&apos;s settings, begin from a Composer
  window:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the Edit menu, and choose Publishing Site Settings. Composer
    displays the Publish Settings dialog box.</li>
  <li>Select a publishing site from the list.</li>
  <li>Click Remove Site.

    <p>Composer only removes the site&apos;s settings; the remote site itself
      is not affected.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Click OK to confirm your changes.</li>

<h2 id="solving_common_publishing_problems">Solving Common Publishing
  Problems</h2>

<p>If one or more of your files fail to publish, the Publishing
  Status dialog box displays an error message that can help you
  determine what went wrong and how to fix it.</p>

<p>If you are still unable to publish a file, save the file to your
  hard disk by opening Composer&apos;s File menu, and choosing Save. You
  can then open the file at a later time to try to publish it. To
  quickly locate the file later, open Composer&apos;s File menu, and
  choose Recent Pages.</p>

<h3 id="verifying_your_publishing_settings">Verifying Your Publishing
  Settings</h3>

<p>To verify your publishing settings:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Close the Publishing Status dialog box, if it is open.</li>
  <li>Open the Edit menu and choose Publishing Site Settings.</li>
  <li>In the Publish Settings dialog box, confirm that the site settings are
    correct for the site you are trying to publish to. If you&apos;re not
    sure, check with your ISP or web hosting service.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Verify that you correctly entered the publishing
        settings</strong>: You may have accidentally mis-typed one of the
        settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Verify that you entered the correct publishing
        address</strong>: Web hosting services or ISPs may refer to the
        publishing address as the <q>server name</q>, the <q>hostname</q>, or
        the <q>server/host</q>. They often specify the publishing location as
        <tt>ftp.myisp.com/username</tt>, where <tt>username</tt> is your
        user name. 

        <p>For the publishing address to be correct, you must precede the
          publishing location with either <tt>ftp://</tt> or <tt>http://</tt>.
          For example, the correct publishing address for the above-mentioned
          site would be <tt>ftp://ftp.myisp.com/username</tt>.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="checking_your_filenames">Checking Your Filenames</h3>

<p>Examine the names of any files that failed to publish. Make sure that the
  filenames:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use only numbers or lowercase or uppercase letters. While it&apos;s
    acceptable to create filenames that use uppercase letters, you can avoid
    potential errors in later locating the published file if you only use
    lowercase letters in your filenames. 

    <p>When you publish files to a web server, filenames become
      case-sensitive on the web server. It may be harder for you to remember
      files names that use only uppercase letters or that use a mix of
      uppercase and lowercase letters.</p>

    <p>For example, when you try to locate a published file by typing the
      filename&apos;s web address into the browser&apos;s Location Bar, you
      must enter the filename exactly as you created it, using the same
      combination of uppercase and lowercase letters.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Don&apos;t use punctuation characters or spaces. Underscores ( _ )
    or hyphens ( - ) are OK.</li>
  <li>End with .html or .htm (for Composer filenames).</li>
  <li>Use less than 32 characters.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="fixing_publishing_errors">Fixing Publishing Errors</h3>

<p>If one or more of your files fails to publish, look at the messages 
  Composer displays in the Publishing Status area of the Publishing dialog box.
  You can use these error messages to help determine what went wrong and what
  to do to fix the problem.</p>

<div class="contentsBox" style="background-color: #ebebeb;">

    <p>or</p>
    <tt><var>X</var> of <var>Y</var> files failed to publish.</tt>
  </div>

  <p><strong>Error Description</strong>: One or more image files or CSS files
    failed to publish because Composer could not find them. Some typical
    reasons might be:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The file location you typed is incorrect.</li>
    <li>The file&apos;s location on the web is not accessible.</li>
    <li>The file&apos;s location was changed or the file was deleted or
      moved to another location.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Possible Solutions</strong>:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Look for broken images in the page you are trying to publish. Broken
      images will appear with this icon
      <img src="images/broken.gif" width="20" height="20" alt="" /> in the
      page. To correct the image&apos;s address, double-click the broken
      image to display the Image Properties dialog box so you can enter the
      correct address.</li>
    <li>Remove the broken image from the page by selecting it (click once on
      the image), and then pressing <kbd>Backspace</kbd> or <kbd>Delete</kbd>
      on your keyboard.</li>
    <li>If the image is unavailable because the server where the image resides
      is inaccessible, try publishing the page at a later time.</li>
    <li>If the missing file is a CSS file, you must first verify the correct
      location of the CSS file. To fix the file&apos;s address in Composer,
      click the HTML Source tab and edit the file&apos;s location in the HTML
      source code. You should only edit the HTML source if you are familiar
      with HTML tags.</li>
  </ul>

    <tt>The filename <var>filename</var> is already in use by another

  </div>

  <p><strong>Error Description</strong>: You specified the name of a remote
    subdirectory that does not exist at the publishing site. Composer can only
    publish to a remote subdirectory that already exists at the publishing
    location. Or, you specified a filename that is identical to the name of an
    existing subdirectory at the publishing site.</p>

  <p>For example, in the Publish Page dialog box, under the Publish tab:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>for <q>Site subdirectory for this page</q>, you may have typed the name
      of a subdirectory that does not exist at the publishing location.</li>
    <li>you checked <q>Include images and other files</q>, and then you typed
      the name of a subdirectory that does not exist at the publishing
      location.</li>
    <li>one of the files you are attempting to publish has the same name as a
      subdirectory at the publishing site.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Possible Solutions</strong>:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Use a separate FTP program if you want to create, rename, or delete
      subdirectories at the publishing site. Ask your service provider if they
      recommend a particular FTP program. You can usually find information on
      FTP programs in the Help or Support sections of your service
      provider&apos;s website. FTP programs are also available from shareware
      sites such as ZDNet Downloads.</li>
    <li>Don&apos;t use subdirectory names that end with <q>.html</q> or
      <q>.htm</q>. Only your Composer filenames should end with <q>.html</q>
      or <q>.htm</q>.</li>
    <li>Subdirectory names are case-sensitive, so be sure to enter a

      due to a technical problem or to an unknown circumstance.</li>
    <li>Your ISP or web hosting service may be experiencing technical
      problems.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Possible Solutions</strong>:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Verify that your publishing settings are correct and that you entered
      them correctly. See
      <a href="#verifying_your_publishing_settings">Verifying Your Publishing
      Settings</a> for more information.</li>
    <li>Make sure your Internet connection is working by attempting to view a

    <li>If your Internet connection is not working, verify that all hardware,
      telephone connections, modems, and network connections are functioning
      properly.</li>
    <li>Use the browser to try to view a page at the website you are
      attempting to publish to. If you can successfully view other websites but
      cannot view a page at the publishing site, your ISP or web hosting

<h3 id="publish_page_publish">Publish Page - Publish</h3>

<p>The Publish Page - Publish tab lets you specify where you want
  to publish a document. These settings apply to the current
  document.</p>

<p>If you are not already viewing the Publish Page - Publish tab,
  follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the File menu and choose Publish As. The Publish Page
    dialog box appears.</li>
  <li>Click the Publish tab.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Site Name</strong>: Lists all the publishing sites you&apos;ve
    created, so you can choose the site that you want to publish to. To
    create a new site, click New Site.</li>
  <li><strong>Page Title</strong>: Specifies the document&apos;s page title as
    it appears in the browser window&apos;s title bar when you view the page in
    the browser. The document&apos;s page title also appears in your list of
    bookmarks if you bookmark the page.</li>
  <li><strong>Filename</strong>: Specifies the document&apos;s filename. Make
    sure you include the .html or .htm extension in the filename.

    <p><strong>Warning</strong>: If a file on the remote site you&apos;re
      publishing to has the same filename as one you&apos;re uploading, the
      newly uploaded file will replace the existing one. You will not be
      asked to confirm the action.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Site subdirectory for this page</strong>: If you leave this
    blank, Composer publishes the page to the main (root) publishing
    directory at this site. If you want to publish the page to a remote
    subdirectory that resides underneath the main publishing directory
    at this site, enter the name of the subdirectory or choose it from
    the list. Composer keeps track of the locations you type here, so
    you can select from a list of remote locations you&apos;ve previously
    used. Keep in mind that subdirectory names are case-sensitive.

    <p><strong>Note</strong>: The site subdirectory you choose must
      already exist at the remote server.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Include images and other files</strong>: If checked,
    Composer publishes any images and other files referenced by this
    page. You can choose to publish these files to the same location as
    the page, or else you can choose to publish these files into a
    remote subdirectory that exists underneath the main publishing
    directory.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: To create remote subdirectories or delete
  published pages or images, you must use an FTP (File Transfer
  Protocol) program. Ask your service provider if they recommend a
  particular FTP program. You can usually find information on FTP
  programs in the Help or Support sections of your service provider&apos;s

<h2 id="composer">Composer Preferences - Composer</h2>

<p>Composer preferences allow you to specify settings for saving files and for
  table editing. These settings apply to every document you create.</p>

<p>If you are not already viewing the Composer preferences, follow these
  steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the <span class="mac">&brandShortName;</span>
    <span class="noMac">Edit</span> menu and choose Preferences.</li>
  <li>Click the Composer category.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Maximum number of pages listed</strong>: Specify the maximum
    number of pages that are listed under Recent Pages in the File menu.</li>
  <li><strong>Preserve original source formatting</strong>: Select this if you
    want to preserve the original white space (extra lines, tabs, etc.) in the
    HTML source code. Deselect this if you prefer Composer to indent and add
    linebreaks to the code in order to make it more readable. <em>This
    preference does not affect how your pages appear in a browser
    window.</em></li>
  <li><strong>Save images and other associated files when saving
    pages</strong>: If checked, all images, JavaScript (JS), Cascading Style
    Sheet (CSS), and other associated files are saved in the same location as
    the document when the document is saved for the first time or when the
    document is saved to a new location. If unchecked, only the HTML file is
    saved.

    <p>For example, when editing a remote page, this setting ensures that all
      related files associated with the remote page will be saved locally when
      you save the page to your hard disk.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Always show Publish dialog when publishing pages</strong>: If
    checked, Composer always displays the Publish Page dialog box when you
    click the Publish button or choose Publish from the File menu. If not
    checked, Composer only displays the Publish Page dialog box if it needs
    more information in order to publish the page.</li>
  <li><strong>Maintain table layout when inserting or deleting cells</strong>:
    Select this if you want Composer to always preserve the table&apos;s
    layout (that is, keep it in a rectangular shape) by adding cells where
    needed. If you deselect this option, when you delete one or more cells,
    Composer removes the cell border as well, which can result in a table with
    empty spaces, or an outline that appears irregular due to an uneven number
    of cells.</li>
  <li><strong>Use CSS styles instead of HTML elements and attributes</strong>:
    Enables the use of Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) formatting in your Composer
    documents. With this preference enabled, Composer generates HTML 4.01
    formatting with CSS inline styles for elements.

    <p>If this preference is not enabled, Composer generates HTML 4.01
      formatting, but does not use CSS styles.</p>

    <p>Compared to HTML, HTML with CSS formatting is more portable, more
      maintainable, and more compatible when viewed with different browsers.
      If you enable this preference and then edit a document created without
      CSS, Composer replaces the edited elements with CSS styles.</p>

    <p>If you enable CSS styles, you can choose a text highlight color for
      selected text using the text highlight color button on the Format
      toolbar. You can also choose a color background for any element on the
      page. (These features are not available if this preference is not
      enabled.)</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong><kbd class="mac">Return</kbd><kbd class="noMac">Enter</kbd> in a
     paragraph always creates a new paragraph</strong>: If selected, a new
     paragraph will be added everytime you press the <kbd class="mac">Return
     </kbd><kbd class="noMac">Enter</kbd> key inside a paragraph. If
     deselected, a linebreak will be added when you press the <kbd
     class="mac">Return</kbd><kbd class="noMac">Enter</kbd> key.</li>
</ul>
