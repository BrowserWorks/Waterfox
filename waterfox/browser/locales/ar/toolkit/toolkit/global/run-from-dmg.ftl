## Strings for a dialog that may open on macOS before the app's main window
## opens. The dialog prompts the user to allow the app to install itself in an
## appropriate location before relaunching itself from that location if the
## user accepts.

## Strings for a dialog that opens if the installation failed.

## Strings for a dialog that recommends to the user to start an existing
## installation of the app in the Applications directory if one is detected,
## rather than the app that was double-clicked in a .dmg.
