# LOCALIZATION NOTE (dayOrdinalSymbol):
# Allows to insert a string, a character or a symbol after the number of a
# monthday in order to give it the meaning of ordinal number e.g.  1 -> 1st etc.
# It's mainly used when formatting dates with both monthday and month name. It
# affects the following localizable strings that hence must be localized *without*
# any ordinal symbol for the monthday number:
#   dayHeaderLabel, monthlyDaysOfNth_day,
#   yearlyNthOn, daysIntervalBetweenYears,
#   daysIntervalBetweenMonths, daysIntervalInMonth.
# Write only a single string if the ordinal symbol is the same for every monthday, otherwise
# write a sequence of _31_ strings (one for each monthday) separated with commas.
# If your language doesn't require that in the mentioned strings, leave it empty.
# e.g.
# dayOrdinalSymbol=.
#    -> daysIntervalInMonth: 'March 3. - 9., 2008'
# dayOrdinalSymbol=st,nd,rd,th,th,th,th,th,th,th,th,th,th,th,th,
#                  th,th,th,th,th,st,nd,rd,th,th,th,th,th,th,th,st
#    -> daysIntervalBetweenMonths: 'September 29th - November 1st, 2008'
