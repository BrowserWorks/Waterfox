# These strings specify the four predefined contexts included in support of the
# Contextual Identity / Containers project. Each context is meant to represent
# the context that the user is in when interacting with the site. Different
# contexts will store cookies and other information from those sites in
# different, isolated locations. You can enable the feature by typing
# about:config in the URL bar and changing privacy.userContext.enabled to true.
# Once enabled, you can open a new tab in a specific context by clicking
# File > New Container Tab > (1 of 4 contexts). Once opened, you will see these
# strings on the right-hand side of the URL bar.
# In android this will be only exposed by web extensions
