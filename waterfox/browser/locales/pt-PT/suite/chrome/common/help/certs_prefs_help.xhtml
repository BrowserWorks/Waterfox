  to present among those you may have on file:</p>

  <li><strong>Select Automatically:</strong> Click this option if you want
    the browser to select a certificate without asking you.</li>

    to ask you which certificate to use each time a website requests one.</li>

<p>Certificates are the digital equivalent of ID cards&mdash;they help other
  people identify you, and they help you identify other people, websites, and
  organizations.</p>

<p>To examine or configure the certificates you have on file, click Manage
  Certificates.</p>

<h3 id="manage_security_devices">Manage Security Devices</h3>

<p>A security device is a hardware or software device that stores your
  certificates and keys. For example, a smart card is a security device. Your
  browser has its own built-in software security device, and you can use
  additional security devices, such as smart cards, at the same time.</p>

<p>To examine or configure your security devices, click Manage Security
  Devices.</p>
