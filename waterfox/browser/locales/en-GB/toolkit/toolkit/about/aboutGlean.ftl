    The <a data-l10n-name="glean-sdk-doc-link">{ glean-sdk-brand-name }</a>

    so that data is still recorded locally.
    Note: If you set a debug tag, pings will be uploaded to the

    Full instructions are documented in the

    and in the <a data-l10n-name="glean-sdk-doc-link">{ glean-sdk-brand-name } documentation</a>,
    but, in short, to manually test that your instrumentation works, you should:

about-glean-no-ping-label = (don’t submit any ping)
# An in-line text input field precedes this string.
about-glean-label-for-tag-pings = In the preceding field ensure there is a memorable debug tag so you can recognise your pings later.
# An in-line drop down list precedes this string.
# Do not translate strings between <code> </code> tags.
about-glean-label-for-ping-names =
    Select from the preceding list the ping your instrumentation is in.
    If it’s in a <a data-l10n-name="custom-ping-link">custom ping</a>, choose that one.
    Otherwise, the default for <code>event</code> metrics is
    the <code>events</code> ping
    and the default for all other metrics is
    the <code>metrics</code> ping.
# An in-line check box precedes this string.
about-glean-label-for-log-pings =
    (Optional. Check the preceding box if you want pings to also be logged when they are submitted.

#   $debug-tag (String): The user-set value of the debug tag input on this page. Like "about-glean-kV"

about-glean-label-for-controls-submit =
    Press the preceding button to tag all { -glean-brand-name } pings with your tag and submit the selected ping.
    (All pings submitted from then until you restart the application will be tagged with
    <code>{ $debug-tag }</code>.)

    <a data-l10n-name="gdpv-tagged-pings-link">Visit the { glean-debug-ping-viewer-brand-name } page for pings with your tag</a>.

    Sometimes it may take a small handful of minutes.

about-glean-adhoc-explanation =
    For more <i>ad hoc</i> testing,
    you can also determine the current value of a particular piece of instrumentation
    by opening a devtools console here on <code>about:glean</code>
    and using the <code>testGetValue()</code> API like
    <code>Glean.metricCategory.metricName.testGetValue()</code>.
