/*
 * Dates in JavaScript are defined by IEEE-754 double precision numbers from
 * the set:
 *
 *   { t ∈ ℕ : -8.64e15 ≤ t ≤ +8.64e15 } ∪ { NaN }
 *
 * The single NaN value represents any invalid-date value.  All other values
 * represent idealized durations in milliseconds since the UTC epoch.  (Leap
 * seconds are ignored; leap days are not.)  +0 is the only zero in this set.
 * The limit represented by 8.64e15 milliseconds is 100 million days either
 * side of 00:00 January 1, 1970 UTC.
 *
 * Dates in the above set are represented by the |ClippedTime| class.  The
 * double type is a superset of the above set, so it *may* (but need not)
 * represent a date.  Use ECMAScript's |TimeClip| method to produce a date from
 * a double.
 *
 * Date *objects* are simply wrappers around |TimeClip|'d numbers, with a bunch
 * of accessor methods to the various aspects of the represented date.

 *
 * In typical use, the user might wish to manipulate a timestamp.  The user

 * date as defined above -- it could have overflowed, acquired a fractional

 * |TimeClip| to produce a number restricted to JavaScript's date range.
 *
 * APIs that accept a JavaScript date value thus accept a |ClippedTime|, not a

 * JavaScript dates.  This also forces users to perform any desired clipping,
 * as only the user knows what behavior is desired when clipping occurs.
