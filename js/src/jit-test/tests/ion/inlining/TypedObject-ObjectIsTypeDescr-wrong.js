/* Used to verify that the JIT resolves the ObjectIsTypeDescr tests
 * internal to Type.equivalent().
 *
 * In this case the argument type is never a type descriptor object,
 * so ObjectIsTypeDescr resolves to false (and we have to catch
 * exceptions).
 *
 * Load this into the js shell with IONFLAGS=logs, then exit and run
 * iongraph.  You're looking for a smallish function within the
 * "self-hosted" domain.  Look for a call to ObjectIsTypeDescr far
 * down in the graph for pass00, with a call to DescrToSource in a
 * subsequent block (all of this is at the mercy of the way the code
 * is currently written).
