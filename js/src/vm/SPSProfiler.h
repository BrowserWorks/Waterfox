/*
 * SPS Profiler integration with the JS Engine
 * https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Performance/Profiling_with_the_Built-in_Profiler
 *
 * The SPS profiler (found in tools/profiler) is an implementation of a profiler
 * which has the ability to walk the C++ stack as well as use instrumentation to
 * gather information. When dealing with JS, however, SPS needs integration
 * with the engine because otherwise it is very difficult to figure out what
 * javascript is executing.
 *
 * The current method of integration with SPS is a form of instrumentation:
 * every time a JS function is entered, a bit of information is pushed onto a
 * stack that SPS owns and maintains. This information is then popped at the end
 * of the JS function. SPS informs the JS engine of this stack at runtime, and
 * it can by turned on/off dynamically.
 *
 * The SPS stack has three parameters: a base pointer, a size, and a maximum
 * size. The stack is the ProfileEntry stack which will have information written
 * to it. The size location is a pointer to an integer which represents the
 * current size of the stack (number of valid frames). This size will be
 * modified when JS functions are called. The maximum specified is the maximum
 * capacity of the ProfileEntry stack.
 *
 * Throughout execution, the size of the stack recorded in memory may exceed the
 * maximum. The JS engine will not write any information past the maximum limit,
 * but it will still maintain the size of the stack. SPS code is aware of this
 * and iterates the stack accordingly.
 *
 * There is some information pushed on the SPS stack for every JS function that
 * is entered. First is a char* pointer of a description of what function was
 * entered. Currently this string is of the form "function (file:line)" if
 * there's a function name, or just "file:line" if there's no function name
 * available. The other bit of information is the relevant C++ (native) stack
 * pointer. This stack pointer is what enables the interleaving of the C++ and
 * the JS stack. Finally, throughout execution of the function, some extra
 * information may be updated on the ProfileEntry structure.
 *
 * = Profile Strings
 *
 * The profile strings' allocations and deallocation must be carefully
 * maintained, and ideally at a very low overhead cost. For this reason, the JS
 * engine maintains a mapping of all known profile strings. These strings are
 * keyed in lookup by a JSScript*, but are serialized with a JSFunction*,
 * JSScript* pair. A JSScript will destroy its corresponding profile string when
 * the script is finalized.
 *
 * For this reason, a char* pointer pushed on the SPS stack is valid only while
 * it is on the SPS stack. SPS uses sampling to read off information from this
 * instrumented stack, and it therefore copies the string byte for byte when a
 * JS function is encountered during sampling.
 *
 * = Native Stack Pointer
 *
 * The actual value pushed as the native pointer is nullptr for most JS
 * functions. The reason for this is that there's actually very little
 * correlation between the JS stack and the C++ stack because many JS functions
 * all run in the same C++ frame, or can even go backwards in C++ when going
 * from the JIT back to the interpreter.
 *
 * To alleviate this problem, all JS functions push nullptr as their "native
 * stack pointer" to indicate that it's a JS function call. The function
 * RunScript(), however, pushes an actual C++ stack pointer onto the SPS stack.
 * This way when interleaving C++ and JS, if SPS sees a nullptr native stack
 * pointer on the SPS stack, it looks backwards for the first non-nullptr
 * pointer and uses that for all subsequent nullptr native stack pointers.
 *
 * = Line Numbers
 *
 * One goal of sampling is to get both a backtrace of the JS stack, but also
 * know where within each function on the stack execution currently is. For
 * this, each ProfileEntry has a 'pc' field to tell where its execution
 * currently is. This field is updated whenever a call is made to another JS
 * function, and for the JIT it is also updated whenever the JIT is left.
 *
 * This field is in a union with a uint32_t 'line' so that C++ can make use of
 * the field as well. It was observed that tracking 'line' via PCToLineNumber in
 * JS was far too expensive, so that is why the pc instead of the translated
 * line number is stored.
 *
 * As an invariant, if the pc is nullptr, then the JIT is currently executing
 * generated code. Otherwise execution is in another JS function or in C++. With
 * this in place, only the top entry of the stack can ever have nullptr as its
 * pc. Additionally with this invariant, it is possible to maintain mappings of
 * JIT code to pc which can be accessed safely because they will only be
 * accessed from a signal handler when the JIT code is executing.
