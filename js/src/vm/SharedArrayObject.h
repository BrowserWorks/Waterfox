 *
 * Observe that if we want to map the data array on a specific address, such
 * as absolute zero (bug 1056027), then the SharedArrayRawBuffer cannot be
 * prefixed to the data array, it has to be a separate object, also in
 * shared memory.  (That would get rid of ~4KB of waste, as well.)  Very little
 * else would have to change throughout the engine, the SARB would point to
 * the data array using a constant pointer, instead of computing its
