/**
 * Frequently we need to run a task on a background thread without blocking
 * the main thread, and then call a callback on the main thread with the
 * result. This class provides the framework for that. Subclasses must:
 *
 *   (1) Override CalculateResult for the off-the-main-thread computation.
 *       NSS functionality may only be accessed within CalculateResult.
 *   (2) Override ReleaseNSSResources to release references to all NSS
 *       resources (that do implement nsNSSShutDownObject themselves).
 *   (3) Override CallCallback() for the on-the-main-thread call of the
 *       callback.
 *
 * CalculateResult, ReleaseNSSResources, and CallCallback are called in order,
 * except CalculateResult might be skipped if NSS is shut down before it can
 * be called; in that case ReleaseNSSResources will be called and then
 * CallCallback will be called with an error code.
 *
 * That sequence of events is what happens if you call Dispatch.  If for
 * some reason, you decide not to run the task (e.g., due to an error in the
 * constructor), you may call Skip, in which case the task is cleaned up and
 * not run.  In that case, only ReleaseNSSResources is called.  (So a
 * subclass must be prepared for ReleaseNSSResources to be run without
 * CalculateResult having been called first.)
 *
 * Once a CryptoTask is created, the calling code must call either
 * Dispatch or Skip.
 *
