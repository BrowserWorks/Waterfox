# BadCertServer takes as an argument a path to a directory and loads
# every key and certificate in it. We want to test what happens when a
# server doesn't include an intermediate that is necessary to build a
# complete trust path. The easiest way to do this right now is to put
# the intermediate in a different directory, so that BadCertServer
# doesn't know about it and can't send it in the TLS handshake.
# Temporarily disabled. See bug 1256495.
