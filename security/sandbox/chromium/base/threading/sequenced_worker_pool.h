// A worker thread pool that enforces ordering between sets of tasks. It also
// allows you to specify what should happen to your tasks on shutdown.
//
// To enforce ordering, get a unique sequence token from the pool and post all
// tasks you want to order with the token. All tasks with the same token are
// guaranteed to execute serially, though not necessarily on the same thread.
// This means that:
//
//   - No two tasks with the same token will run at the same time.
//
//   - Given two tasks T1 and T2 with the same token such that T2 will
//     run after T1, then T2 will start after T1 is destroyed.
//
//   - If T2 will run after T1, then all memory changes in T1 and T1's
//     destruction will be visible to T2.
//
// Example:
//   SequencedWorkerPool::SequenceToken token = pool.GetSequenceToken();
//   pool.PostSequencedWorkerTask(token, SequencedWorkerPool::SKIP_ON_SHUTDOWN,
//                                FROM_HERE, base::Bind(...));
//   pool.PostSequencedWorkerTask(token, SequencedWorkerPool::SKIP_ON_SHUTDOWN,
//                                FROM_HERE, base::Bind(...));
//
// You can make named sequence tokens to make it easier to share a token
// across different components.
//
// You can also post tasks to the pool without ordering using PostWorkerTask.
// These will be executed in an unspecified order. The order of execution
// between tasks with different sequence tokens is also unspecified.
//
// This class may be leaked on shutdown to facilitate fast shutdown. The
// expected usage, however, is to call Shutdown(), which correctly accounts
// for CONTINUE_ON_SHUTDOWN behavior and is required for BLOCK_SHUTDOWN
// behavior.
//
// Implementation note: This does not use a base::WorkerPool since that does
// not enforce shutdown semantics or allow us to specify how many worker
// threads to run. For the typical use case of random background work, we don't
// necessarily want to be super aggressive about creating threads.
//
// Note that SequencedWorkerPool is RefCountedThreadSafe (inherited
// from TaskRunner).
//
// Test-only code should wrap this in a base::SequencedWorkerPoolOwner to avoid
// memory leaks. See http://crbug.com/273800

    // This option provides a nice way to post stuff you don't want blocking
    // shutdown. For example, you might be doing a slow DNS lookup and if it's
    // blocked on the OS, you may not want to stop shutdown, since the result
    // doesn't really matter at that point.
    //
    // However, you need to be very careful what you do in your callback when
    // you use this option. Since the thread will continue to run until the OS
    // terminates the process, the app can be in the process of tearing down
    // when you're running. This means any singletons or global objects you
    // use may suddenly become invalid out from under you. For this reason,
    // it's best to use this only for slow but simple operations like the DNS
    // example.

    // Tasks posted with this mode that have not started executing at
    // shutdown will be deleted rather than executed. However, any tasks that

    // to continue, and will block shutdown until completion.

    // called Shutdown(), as this may lead to deadlock.

    // writing a preference file.
