// Document if a shared variable/field needs to be protected by a lock.
// GUARDED_BY allows the user to specify a particular lock that should be
// held when accessing the annotated variable, while GUARDED_VAR only
// indicates a shared variable should be guarded (by any lock). GUARDED_VAR
// is primarily used when the client cannot express the name of the lock.

// PT_GUARDED_VAR is primarily used when the client cannot express the name
// of the lock. Note that a pointer variable to a shared memory location
// could itself be a shared variable. For example, if a shared global pointer
// q, which is guarded by mu1, points to a shared memory location that is
// guarded by mu2, q should be annotated as follows:
