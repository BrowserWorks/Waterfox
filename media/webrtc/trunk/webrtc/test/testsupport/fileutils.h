// and other test artifacts should be put. The output directory is generally a
// directory named "out" at the top-level of the project, i.e. a subfolder to
// the path returned by ProjectRootPath(). The exception is Android where we use
// /sdcard/ instead.
//
// If symbolic links occur in the path they will be resolved and the actual
// directory will be returned.
//
// Returns the path WITH a trailing path delimiter. If the project root is not
// found, the current working directory ("./") is returned as a fallback.

// Adapts to what filenames are currently present in the
// [project-root]/resources/ dir.

// part of the path is left out for readability):
// 1. [name]_[platform]_[architecture].[extension]
// 2. [name]_[platform].[extension]
// 3. [name]_[architecture].[extension]

// Where
// * platform is either of "win", "mac" or "linux".

//    name - Name of the resource file. If a plain filename (no directory path)
//           is supplied, the file is assumed to be located in resources/
//           If a directory path is prepended to the filename, a subdirectory
//           hierarchy reflecting that path is assumed to be present.
//    extension - File extension, without the dot, i.e. "bmp" or "yuv".
