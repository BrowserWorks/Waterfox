This directory holds a Java implementation of the webrtc::PeerConnection API, as
well as the JNI glue C++ code that lets the Java implementation reuse the C++
implementation of the same API.

To build the Java API and related tests, generate GN projects with:
--args='target_os="android"'

To use the Java API, start by looking at the public interface of
org.webrtc.PeerConnection{,Factory} and the org.webrtc.PeerConnectionTest.

To understand the implementation of the API, see the native code in jni/.
