  /**
   * Set the time to use for starting or pausing a pending animation.
   *
   * Typically, when an animation is played, it does not start immediately but
   * is added to a table of pending animations on the document of its effect.
   * In the meantime it sets its hold time to the time from which playback
   * should begin.
   *
   * When the document finishes painting, any pending animations in its table
   * are marked as being ready to start by calling StartOnNextTick.
   * The moment when the paint completed is also recorded, converted to a
   * timeline time, and passed to StartOnTick. This is so that when these
   * animations do start, they can be timed from the point when painting
   * completed.
   *
   * After calling TriggerOnNextTick, animations remain in the pending state
   * until the next refresh driver tick. At that time they transition out of
   * the pending state using the time passed to TriggerOnNextTick as the
   * effective time at which they resumed.
   *
   * This approach means that any setup time required for performing the
   * initial paint of an animation such as layerization is not deducted from
   * the running time of the animation. Without this we can easily drop the
   * first few frames of an animation, or, on slower devices, the whole
   * animation.
   *
   * Furthermore:
   *
   * - Starting the animation immediately when painting finishes is problematic
   *   because the start time of the animation will be ahead of its timeline
   *   (since the timeline time is based on the refresh driver time).
   *   That's a problem because the animation is playing but its timing
   *   suggests it starts in the future. We could update the timeline to match
   *   the start time of the animation but then we'd also have to update the
   *   timing and style of all animations connected to that timeline or else be
   *   stuck in an inconsistent state until the next refresh driver tick.
   *
   * - If we simply use the refresh driver time on its next tick, the lag
   *   between triggering an animation and its effective start is unacceptably
   *   long.
   *
   * For pausing, we apply the same asynchronous approach. This is so that we
   * synchronize with animations that are running on the compositor. Otherwise
   * if the main thread lags behind the compositor there will be a noticeable
   * jump backwards when the main thread takes over. Even though main thread
   * animations could be paused immediately, we do it asynchronously for
   * consistency and so that animations paused together end up in step.
   *
   * Note that the caller of this method is responsible for removing the
   * animation from any PendingAnimationTracker it may have been added to.

   * should initialize them with the start time that GetStartTime() will return

   * start time would be updated to the current wallclock time when rendering
