  /**
   * This enum specifies where this graph is in its lifecycle. This is used
   * to control shutdown.
   * Shutdown is tricky because it can happen in two different ways:
   * 1) Shutdown due to inactivity. RunThread() detects that it has no
   * pending messages and no streams, and exits. The next RunInStableState()
   * checks if there are new pending messages from the main thread (true only
   * if new stream creation raced with shutdown); if there are, it revives
   * RunThread(), otherwise it commits to shutting down the graph. New stream
   * creation after this point will create a new graph. An async event is
   * dispatched to Shutdown() the graph's threads and then delete the graph
   * object.
   * 2) Forced shutdown at application shutdown, or completion of a
   * non-realtime graph. A flag is set, RunThread() detects the flag and
   * exits, the next RunInStableState() detects the flag, and dispatches the
   * async event to Shutdown() the graph's threads. However the graph object
   * is not deleted. New messages for the graph are processed synchronously on
   * the main thread if necessary. When the last stream is destroyed, the
   * graph object is deleted.
   *
   * This should be kept in sync with the LifecycleState_str array in
   * MediaStreamGraph.cpp
