/**
 * A consumer of audio/video data which plays audio and video tracks and
 * manages A/V sync between them.
 *
 * A typical sink sends audio/video outputs to the speaker and screen.
 * However, there are also sinks which capture the output of an media element
 * and send the output to a MediaStream.
 *
 * This class is used to move A/V sync management and audio/video rendering
 * out of MDSM so it is possible for subclasses to do external rendering using
 * specific hardware which is required by TV projects and CDM.
 *
 * Note this class is not thread-safe and should be called from the state
 * machine thread only.
