// This class implements a lock-free multiple producer single consumer queue of
// fixed size log messages, with the following characteristics:
// - Unbounded (uses a intrinsic linked list)
// - Allocates on Push. Push can be called on any thread.
// - Deallocates on Pop. Pop MUST always be called on the same thread for the
// life-time of the queue.
//
// In our scenario, the producer threads are real-time, they can't block. The
// consummer thread runs every now and then and empties the queue to a log
// file, on disk.
//
// Having fixed size messages and jemalloc is probably not the fastest, but
// allows having a simpler design, we count on the fact that jemalloc will get
// the memory from a thread-local source most of the time.

    // just allocated, with strong memory order. From now one, any thread
    // that reaches A will see that the node just allocated is
    // effectively the head of the list, and will make itself the new head
    // of the list.
    // In a bad case (when thread i executes A and then

    // they all have the correct value for the next node to set as their
    // mNext member on their respective stacks (in `prev`), and this is
    // always correct. When the scheduler resumes, and line B is executed,
    // the correct linkage is resumed.
    // Before line B, since mNext for the node the was the last element of
    // the queue still has an mNext of nullptr, Pop will not see the node
    // added.
