 * A driver is responsible for the scheduling of the processing, the thread
 * management, and give the different clocks to a MediaStreamGraph. This is an
 * abstract base class. A MediaStreamGraph can be driven by an
 * OfflineClockDriver, if the graph is offline, or a SystemClockDriver, if the
 * graph is real time.
 * A MediaStreamGraph holds an owning reference to its driver.
 *
 * The lifetime of drivers is a complicated affair. Here are the different
 * scenarii that can happen:
 *
 * Starting a MediaStreamGraph with an AudioCallbackDriver
 * - A new thread T is created, from the main thread.
 * - On this thread T, cubeb is initialized if needed, and a cubeb_stream is
 *   created and started
 * - The thread T posts a message to the main thread to terminate itself.
 * - The graph runs off the audio thread
 *
 * Starting a MediaStreamGraph with a SystemClockDriver:
 * - A new thread T is created from the main thread.
 * - The graph runs off this thread.
 *
 * Switching from a SystemClockDriver to an AudioCallbackDriver:
 * - A new AudioCallabackDriver is created and initialized on the graph thread
 * - At the end of the MSG iteration, the SystemClockDriver transfers its timing
 *   info and a reference to itself to the AudioCallbackDriver. It then starts
 *   the AudioCallbackDriver.
 * - When the AudioCallbackDriver starts, it checks if it has been switched from
 *   a SystemClockDriver, and if that is the case, sends a message to the main
 *   thread to shut the SystemClockDriver thread down.
 * - The graph now runs off an audio callback
 *
 * Switching from an AudioCallbackDriver to a SystemClockDriver:
 * - A new SystemClockDriver is created, and set as mNextDriver.
 * - At the end of the MSG iteration, the AudioCallbackDriver transfers its
 *   timing info and a reference to itself to the SystemClockDriver. A new
 *   SystemClockDriver is started from the current audio thread.
 * - When starting, the SystemClockDriver checks if it has been switched from an
 *   AudioCallbackDriver. If yes, it creates a new temporary thread to release
 *   the cubeb_streams. This temporary thread closes the cubeb_stream, and
 *   then dispatches a message to the main thread to be terminated.
 * - The graph now runs off a normal thread.
 *
 * Two drivers cannot run at the same time for the same graph. The thread safety
 * of the different attributes of drivers, and they access pattern is documented
 * next to the members themselves.

 * - Creating and shutting the thread down is a blocking operation, that can
 *   take _seconds_ in some cases (because IPC has to be set up, and
 *   sometimes hardware components are involved and need to be warmed up)
 * - We have no control on how much audio we generate, we have to return exactly
 *   the number of frames asked for by the callback. Since for the Web Audio
 *   API, we have to do block processing at 128 frames per block, we need to
