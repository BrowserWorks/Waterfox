# This file contains mappings from languages to legacy encodings for languages
# that are associated with legacy encoding other than windows-1252 (except
# Traditional Chinese, which is handled as a special case elsewhere).
#
# The keys are language codes without regions. The values are Gecko-canonical
# encoding labels (not necessarily lower case!).
#
# Rules:
#
# * Avoid editing this file!
#
# * If you do edit this file, be sure to file a spec bug against WHATWG HTML
#   to keep this file in sync with
#   http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/parsing.html#determining-the-character-encoding
#
# * As an exception to the previous rule, GBK is used instead of GB18030
#   until/unless work on http://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/ shows that the former
#   can be treated as an alias of the latter and our decoder implementation
#   has been audited to match the spec.
#
# * Use only the language code without a hyphen or anything that would come
#   after the hyphen.
#
# * Don't put windows-1252-affiliated languages here.
#
# * Don't put Traditional Chinese here.
