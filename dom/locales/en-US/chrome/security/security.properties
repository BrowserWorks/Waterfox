# LOCALIZATION NOTE: Do not translate "SHA-1"
SHA1Sig=This site makes use of a SHA-1 Certificate; it’s recommended you use certificates with signature algorithms that use hash functions stronger than SHA-1.
InsecurePasswordsPresentOnPage=Password fields present on an insecure (http://) page. This is a security risk that allows user login credentials to be stolen.
InsecureFormActionPasswordsPresent=Password fields present in a form with an insecure (http://) form action. This is a security risk that allows user login credentials to be stolen.
InsecurePasswordsPresentOnIframe=Password fields present on an insecure (http://) iframe. This is a security risk that allows user login credentials to be stolen.
# LOCALIZATION NOTE: "%1$S" is the URI of the insecure mixed content resource

InvalidIntegrityLength=The hash contained in the integrity attribute has the wrong length.
# LOCALIZATION NOTE: Do not translate "integrity"
InvalidIntegrityBase64=The hash contained in the integrity attribute could not be decoded.

IntegrityMismatch=None of the “%1$S” hashes in the integrity attribute match the content of the subresource.
# LOCALIZATION NOTE: "%1$S" is the URI of the sub-resource that cannot be protected using SRI.
IneligibleResource=“%1$S” is not eligible for integrity checks since it’s neither CORS-enabled nor same-origin.
# LOCALIZATION NOTE: Do not translate "integrity". "%1$S" is the invalid hash algorithm found in the attribute.
UnsupportedHashAlg=Unsupported hash algorithm in the integrity attribute: “%1$S”
# LOCALIZATION NOTE: Do not translate "integrity"
NoValidMetadata=The integrity attribute does not contain any valid metadata.
