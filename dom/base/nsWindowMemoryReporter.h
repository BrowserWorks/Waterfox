/**
 * nsWindowMemoryReporter is responsible for the 'explicit/window-objects'
 * memory reporter.
 *
 * We classify DOM window objects into one of three categories:
 *
 *   - "active" windows, which are displayed in a tab (as the top-level window
 *     or an iframe),
 *
 *   - "cached" windows, which are in the fastback cache (aka the bfcache), and
 *
 *   - "detached" windows, which have a null docshell.  A window becomes
 *     detached when its <iframe> or tab containing the window is destroyed --
 *     i.e., when the window is no longer active or cached.
 *
 * Additionally, we classify a subset of detached windows as "ghost" windows.
 * Although ghost windows can happen legitimately (a page can hold a reference
 * to a cross-domain window and then close its container), the presence of
 * ghost windows is often indicative of a memory leak.
 *
 * A window is a ghost if it meets the following three criteria:
 *
 *   1) The window is detached.
 *
 *   2) There exist no non-detached windows with the same base domain as
 *      the window's principal.  (For example, the base domain of
 *      "wiki.mozilla.co.uk" is "mozilla.co.uk".)  This criterion makes us less
 *      likely to flag a legitimately held-alive detached window as a ghost.
 *
 *   3) The window has met criteria (1) and (2) above for at least
 *      memory.ghost_window_timeout_seconds.  This criterion is in place so we
 *      don't immediately declare a window a ghost before the GC/CC has had a
 *      chance to run.
 *
 * nsWindowMemoryReporter observes window detachment and uses mDetachedWindows
 * to remember when a window first met criteria (1) and (2).  When we generate
 * a memory report, we use this accounting to determine which windows are
 * ghosts.
 *
 *
 * We use the following memory reporter path for active and cached windows:
 *
 *   explicit/window-objects/top(<top-outer-uri>, id=<top-outer-id>)/<category>/window(<window-uri>)/...
 *
 * For detached and ghost windows, we use
 *
 *   explicit/window-objects/top(none)/<category>/window(<window-uri>)/...
 *
 * Where
 *
 * - <category> is "active", "cached", "detached", or "ghost", as described
 *   above.
 *
 * - <top-outer-id> is the window id of the top outer window (i.e. the tab, or
 *   the top level chrome window).  Exposing this ensures that each tab gets
 *   its own sub-tree, even if multiple tabs are showing the same URI.
 *
 * - <top-uri> is the URI of the top window.  Excepting special windows (such
 *   as browser.xul or hiddenWindow.html) it's what the address bar shows for
 *   the tab.
 *
