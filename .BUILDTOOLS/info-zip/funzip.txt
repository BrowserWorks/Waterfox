NAME
       funzip - filter for extracting from a ZIP archive in a pipe

SYNOPSIS
       funzip [-password] [input[.zip|.gz]]

ARGUMENTS
       [-password]
              Optional  password  to  be  used  if  ZIP  archive is encrypted.
              Decryption may not be supported at some sites.  See  DESCRIPTION
              for more details.

       [input[.zip|.gz]]
              Optional  input  archive file specification. See DESCRIPTION for
              details.

DESCRIPTION
       funzip without a file argument acts as a filter; that  is,  it  assumes
       that  a  ZIP archive (or a gzip'd(1) file) is being piped into standard
       input, and it extracts the first member from  the  archive  to  stdout.
       When  stdin comes from a tty device, funzip assumes that this cannot be
       a stream of (binary) compressed data  and  shows  a  short  help  text,
       instead.   If  there  is  a  file argument, then input is read from the
       specified file instead of from stdin.

       A password for encrypted zip files can be specified on the command line
       (preceding  the  file  name,  if  any) by prefixing the password with a
       dash.  Note that this constitutes a security risk on many systems; cur-
       rently  running  processes are often visible via simple commands (e.g.,
       ps(1) under Unix), and command-line histories  can  be  read.   If  the
       first  entry  of the zip file is encrypted and no password is specified
       on the command line, then the user is prompted for a password  and  the
       password is not echoed on the console.

       Given the limitation on single-member extraction, funzip is most useful
       in conjunction with a secondary archiver program such as  tar(1).   The
       following  section  includes  an example illustrating this usage in the
       case of disk backups to tape.

EXAMPLES
       To use funzip to extract the first member file of the archive  test.zip
       and to pipe it into more(1):

           funzip test.zip | more

       To  use  funzip  to  test the first member file of test.zip (any errors
       will be reported on standard error):

           funzip test.zip > /dev/null

       To use zip and funzip in place of compress(1) and zcat(1) (or  gzip(1L)
       and gzcat(1L)) for tape backups:

           tar cf - . | zip -7 | dd of=/dev/nrst0 obs=8k
           dd if=/dev/nrst0 ibs=8k | funzip | tar xf -

       (where, for example, nrst0 is a SCSI tape drive).

BUGS
       When  piping  an encrypted file into more and allowing funzip to prompt
       for password, the terminal may sometimes be reset to a  non-echo  mode.
       This  is  apparently  due to a race condition between the two programs;
       funzip changes the terminal mode to  non-echo  before  more  reads  its
       state,  and  more  then  ``restores''  the terminal to this mode before
       exiting.  To recover, run funzip on  the  same  file  but  redirect  to
       /dev/null  rather  than piping into more; after prompting again for the
       password, funzip will reset the terminal properly.

       There is presently no way to extract any member but the  first  from  a
       ZIP  archive.   This would be useful in the case where a ZIP archive is
       included within another archive.  In the case where the first member is
       a directory, funzip simply creates the directory and exits.

       The  functionality  of  funzip should be incorporated into unzip itself
       (future release).
