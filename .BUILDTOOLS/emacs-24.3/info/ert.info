ERT: Emacs Lisp Regression Testing
**********************************

ERT is a tool for automated testing in Emacs Lisp.  Its main features
are facilities for defining tests, running them and reporting the
results, and for debugging test failures interactively.

   ERT is similar to tools for other environments such as JUnit, but has
unique features that take advantage of the dynamic and interactive
nature of Emacs.  Despite its name, it works well both for test-driven
development (see
`http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development') and for
traditional software development methods.

1 Introduction
**************

ERT allows you to define _tests_ in addition to functions, macros,
variables, and the other usual Lisp constructs.  Tests are simply Lisp
code: code that invokes other code and checks whether it behaves as
expected.

   ERT keeps track of the tests that are defined and provides convenient
commands to run them to verify whether the definitions that are
currently loaded in Emacs pass the tests.

   Some Lisp files have comments like the following (adapted from the
package `pp.el'):

     ;; (pp-to-string '(quote quote))          ; expected: "'quote"
     ;; (pp-to-string '((quote a) (quote b)))  ; expected: "('a 'b)\n"
     ;; (pp-to-string '('a 'b))                ; same as above

   The code contained in these comments can be evaluated from time to
time to compare the output with the expected output.  ERT formalizes
this and introduces a common convention, which simplifies Emacs
development, since programmers no longer have to manually find and
evaluate such comments.

   An ERT test definition equivalent to the above comments is this:

     (ert-deftest pp-test-quote ()
       "Tests the rendering of `quote' symbols in `pp-to-string'."
       (should (equal (pp-to-string '(quote quote)) "'quote"))
       (should (equal (pp-to-string '((quote a) (quote b))) "('a 'b)\n"))
       (should (equal (pp-to-string '('a 'b)) "('a 'b)\n")))

   If you know `defun', the syntax of `ert-deftest' should look
familiar: This example defines a test named `pp-test-quote' that will
pass if the three calls to `equal' all return true (non-nil).

   `should' is a macro with the same meaning as `cl-assert' but better
error reporting.  *Note The `should' Macro::.

   Each test should have a name that describes what functionality it
tests.  Test names can be chosen arbitrarily--they are in a namespace
separate from functions and variables--but should follow the usual
Emacs Lisp convention of having a prefix that indicates which package
they belong to.  Test names are displayed by ERT when reporting
failures and can be used when selecting which tests to run.

   The empty parentheses `()' in the first line don't currently have
any meaning and are reserved for future extension.  They also make the
syntax of `ert-deftest' more similar to that of `defun'.

   The docstring describes what feature this test tests.  When running
tests interactively, the first line of the docstring is displayed for
tests that fail, so it is good if the first line makes sense on its own.

   The body of a test can be arbitrary Lisp code.  It should have as few
side effects as possible; each test should be written to clean up after
itself, leaving Emacs in the same state as it was before the test.
Tests should clean up even if they fail.  *Note Tests and Their
Environment::.

2 How to Run Tests
******************

You can run tests either in the Emacs you are working in, or on the
command line in a separate Emacs process in batch mode (i.e., with no
user interface).  The former mode is convenient during interactive
development, the latter is useful to make sure that tests pass
independently of your customizations; and it allows you to invoke tests
from makefiles, and to write scripts that run tests in several
different Emacs versions.

* Menu:

* Running Tests Interactively::  Run tests in your current Emacs.
* Running Tests in Batch Mode::  Run tests in emacs -Q.
* Test Selectors::               Choose which tests to run.


File: ert.info,  Node: Running Tests Interactively,  Next: Running Tests in Batch Mode,  Prev: How to Run Tests,  Up: How to Run Tests

2.1 Running Tests Interactively
===============================

You can run the tests that are currently defined in your Emacs with the
command `M-x ert RET t RET'.  (For an explanation of the `t' argument,
*note Test Selectors::.) ERT will pop up a new buffer, the ERT results
buffer, showing the results of the tests run.  It looks like this:

     Selector: t
     Passed: 31
     Failed: 2 (2 unexpected)
     Total:  33/33

     Started at:   2008-09-11 08:39:25-0700
     Finished.
     Finished at:  2008-09-11 08:39:27-0700

     FF...............................

     F addition-test
         (ert-test-failed
          ((should
            (=
             (+ 1 2)
             4))
           :form
           (= 3 4)
           :value nil))

     F list-test
         (ert-test-failed
          ((should
            (equal
             (list 'a 'b 'c)
             '(a b d)))
           :form
           (equal
            (a b c)
            (a b d))
           :value nil :explanation
           (list-elt 2
                     (different-atoms c d))))

   At the top, there is a summary of the results: we ran all tests
defined in the current Emacs (`Selector: t'), 31 of them passed, and 2
failed unexpectedly.  *Note Expected Failures::, for an explanation of
the term _unexpected_ in this context.

   The line of dots and `F's is a progress bar where each character
represents one test; it fills while the tests are running.  A dot means
that the test passed, an `F' means that it failed.  Below the progress
bar, ERT shows details about each test that had an unexpected result.
In the example above, there are two failures, both due to failed
`should' forms.  *Note Understanding Explanations::, for more details.

   In the ERT results buffer, `TAB' and `S-TAB' cycle between buttons.
Each name of a function or macro in this buffer is a button; moving
point to it and typing `RET' jumps to its definition.

   Pressing `r' re-runs the test near point on its own.  Pressing `d'
re-runs it with the debugger enabled.  `.' jumps to the definition of
the test near point (`RET' has the same effect if point is on the name
of the test).  On a failed test, `b' shows the backtrace of the failure.

   `l' shows the list of `should' forms executed in the test.  If any
messages were generated (with the Lisp function `message') in a test or
any of the code that it invoked, `m' will show them.

   By default, long expressions in the failure details are abbreviated
using `print-length' and `print-level'.  Pressing `L' while point is on
a test failure will increase the limits to show more of the expression.

2.2 Running Tests in Batch Mode
===============================

ERT supports automated invocations from the command line or from
scripts or makefiles.  There are two functions for this purpose,
`ert-run-tests-batch' and `ert-run-tests-batch-and-exit'.  They can be
used like this:

     emacs -batch -l ert -l my-tests.el -f ert-run-tests-batch-and-exit

   This command will start up Emacs in batch mode, load ERT, load
`my-tests.el', and run all tests defined in it.  It will exit with a
zero exit status if all tests passed, or nonzero if any tests failed or
if anything else went wrong.  It will also print progress messages and
error diagnostics to standard output.

   If ERT is not part of your Emacs distribution, you may need to use
`-L /path/to/ert/' so that Emacs can find it.  You may need additional
`-L' flags to ensure that `my-tests.el' and all the files that it
requires are on your `load-path'.


File: ert.info,  Node: Test Selectors,  Prev: Running Tests in Batch Mode,  Up: How to Run Tests

2.3 Test Selectors
==================

Functions like `ert' accept a _test selector_, a Lisp expression
specifying a set of tests.  Test selector syntax is similar to Common
Lisp's type specifier syntax:

   * `nil' selects no tests.

   * `t' selects all tests.

   * `:new' selects all tests that have not been run yet.

   * `:failed' and `:passed' select tests according to their most
     recent result.

   * `:expected', `:unexpected' select tests according to their most
     recent result.

   * A string is a regular expression that selects all tests with
     matching names.

   * A test (i.e., an object of `ert-test' data type) selects that test.

   * A symbol selects the test that the symbol names.

   * `(member TESTS...)' selects the elements of TESTS, a list of tests
     or symbols naming tests.

   * `(eql TEST)' selects TEST, a test or a symbol naming a test.

   * `(and SELECTORS...)' selects the tests that match all SELECTORS.

   * `(or SELECTORS...)' selects the tests that match any SELECTOR.

   * `(not SELECTOR)' selects all tests that do not match SELECTOR.

   * `(tag TAG)' selects all tests that have TAG on their tags list.
     (Tags are optional labels you can apply to tests when you define
     them.)

   * `(satisfies PREDICATE)' selects all tests that satisfy PREDICATE,
     a function that takes a test as argument and returns non-nil if it
     is selected.

   Selectors that are frequently useful when selecting tests to run
include `t' to run all tests that are currently defined in Emacs,
`"^foo-"' to run all tests in package `foo' (this assumes that package
`foo' uses the prefix `foo-' for its test names), result-based
selectors such as `(or :new :unexpected)' to run all tests that have
either not run yet or that had an unexpected result in the last run,
and tag-based selectors such as `(not (tag :causes-redisplay))' to run
all tests that are not tagged `:causes-redisplay'.

3 How to Write Tests
********************

ERT lets you define tests in the same way you define functions.  You
can type `ert-deftest' forms in a buffer and evaluate them there with
`eval-defun' or `compile-defun', or you can save the file and load it,
optionally byte-compiling it first.

   Just like `find-function' is only able to find where a function was
defined if the function was loaded from a file, ERT is only able to
find where a test was defined if the test was loaded from a file.

File: ert.info,  Node: The `should' Macro,  Next: Expected Failures,  Prev: How to Write Tests,  Up: How to Write Tests

3.1 The `should' Macro
======================

Test bodies can include arbitrary code; but to be useful, they need to
check whether the code being tested (or _code under test_) does what it
is supposed to do.  The macro `should' is similar to `cl-assert' from
the cl package (*note Assertions: (cl)Assertions.), but analyzes its
argument form and records information that ERT can display to help
debugging.

   This test definition

     (ert-deftest addition-test ()
       (should (= (+ 1 2) 4)))

   will produce this output when run via `M-x ert':

     F addition-test
         (ert-test-failed
          ((should
            (=
             (+ 1 2)
             4))
           :form
           (= 3 4)
           :value nil))

   In this example, `should' recorded the fact that (= (+ 1 2) 4)
reduced to (= 3 4) before it reduced to nil.  When debugging why the
test failed, it helps to know that the function `+' returned 3 here.
ERT records the return value for any predicate called directly within
`should'.

   In addition to `should', ERT provides `should-not', which checks
that the predicate returns nil, and `should-error', which checks that
the form called within it signals an error.  An example use of
`should-error':

     (ert-deftest test-divide-by-zero ()
       (should-error (/ 1 0)
                     :type 'arith-error))

   This checks that dividing one by zero signals an error of type
`arith-error'.  The `:type' argument to `should-error' is optional; if
absent, any type of error is accepted.  `should-error' returns an error
description of the error that was signaled, to allow additional checks
to be made.  The error description has the format `(ERROR-SYMBOL .
DATA)'.

   There is no `should-not-error' macro since tests that signal an
error fail anyway, so `should-not-error' is effectively the default.

   *Note Understanding Explanations::, for more details on what
`should' reports.


File: ert.info,  Node: Expected Failures,  Next: Tests and Their Environment,  Prev: The `should' Macro,  Up: How to Write Tests

3.2 Expected Failures
=====================

Some bugs are complicated to fix, or not very important, and are left as
_known bugs_.  If there is a test case that triggers the bug and fails,
ERT will alert you of this failure every time you run all tests.  For
known bugs, this alert is a distraction.  The way to suppress it is to
add `:expected-result :failed' to the test definition:

     (ert-deftest future-bug ()
       "Test `time-forward' with negative arguments.
     Since this functionality isn't implemented, the test is known to fail."
       :expected-result :failed
       (time-forward -1))

   ERT will still display a small `f' in the progress bar as a reminder
that there is a known bug, and will count the test as failed, but it
will be quiet about it otherwise.

   An alternative to marking the test as a known failure this way is to
delete the test.  This is a good idea if there is no intent to fix it,
i.e., if the behavior that was formerly considered a bug has become an
accepted feature.

   In general, however, it can be useful to keep tests that are known to
fail.  If someone wants to fix the bug, they will have a very good
starting point: an automated test case that reproduces the bug.  This
makes it much easier to fix the bug, demonstrate that it is fixed, and
prevent future regressions.

   ERT displays the same kind of alerts for tests that pass unexpectedly
as it displays for unexpected failures.  This way, if you make code
changes that happen to fix a bug that you weren't aware of, you will
know to remove the `:expected-result' clause of that test and close the
corresponding bug report, if any.

   Since `:expected-result' evaluates its argument when the test is
loaded, tests can be marked as known failures only on certain Emacs
versions, specific architectures, etc.:

     (ert-deftest foo ()
       "A test that is expected to fail on Emacs 23 but succeed elsewhere."
       :expected-result (if (string-match "GNU Emacs 23[.]" (emacs-version))
                            :failed
                          :passed)
       ...)


File: ert.info,  Node: Tests and Their Environment,  Next: Useful Techniques,  Prev: Expected Failures,  Up: How to Write Tests

3.3 Tests and Their Environment
===============================

The outcome of running a test should not depend on the current state of
the environment, and each test should leave its environment in the same
state it found it in.  In particular, a test should not depend on any
Emacs customization variables or hooks, and if it has to make any
changes to Emacs's state or state external to Emacs (such as the file
system), it should undo these changes before it returns, regardless of
whether it passed or failed.

   Tests should not depend on the environment because any such
dependencies can make the test brittle or lead to failures that occur
only under certain circumstances and are hard to reproduce.  Of course,
the code under test may have settings that affect its behavior.  In
that case, it is best to make the test `let'-bind all such setting
variables to set up a specific configuration for the duration of the
test.  The test can also set up a number of different configurations
and run the code under test with each.

   Tests that have side effects on their environment should restore it
to its original state because any side effects that persist after the
test can disrupt the workflow of the programmer running the tests.  If
the code under test has side effects on Emacs's current state, such as
on the current buffer or window configuration, the test should create a
temporary buffer for the code to manipulate (using `with-temp-buffer'),
or save and restore the window configuration (using
`save-window-excursion'), respectively.  For aspects of the state that
can not be preserved with such macros, cleanup should be performed with
`unwind-protect', to ensure that the cleanup occurs even if the test
fails.

   An exception to this are messages that the code under test prints
with `message' and similar logging; tests should not bother restoring
the `*Message*' buffer to its original state.

   The above guidelines imply that tests should avoid calling highly
customizable commands such as `find-file', except, of course, if such
commands are what they want to test.  The exact behavior of `find-file'
depends on many settings such as `find-file-wildcards',
`enable-local-variables', and `auto-mode-alist'.  It is difficult to
write a meaningful test if its behavior can be affected by so many
external factors.  Also, `find-file' has side effects that are hard to
predict and thus hard to undo: It may create a new buffer or reuse an
existing buffer if one is already visiting the requested file; and it
runs `find-file-hook', which can have arbitrary side effects.

   Instead, it is better to use lower-level mechanisms with simple and
predictable semantics like `with-temp-buffer', `insert' or
`insert-file-contents-literally', and to activate any desired mode by
calling the corresponding function directly, after binding the hook
variables to nil.  This avoids the above problems.


File: ert.info,  Node: Useful Techniques,  Prev: Tests and Their Environment,  Up: How to Write Tests

3.4 Useful Techniques when Writing Tests
========================================

Testing simple functions that have no side effects and no dependencies
on their environment is easy.  Such tests often look like this:

     (ert-deftest ert-test-mismatch ()
       (should (eql (ert--mismatch "" "") nil))
       (should (eql (ert--mismatch "" "a") 0))
       (should (eql (ert--mismatch "a" "a") nil))
       (should (eql (ert--mismatch "ab" "a") 1))
       (should (eql (ert--mismatch "Aa" "aA") 0))
       (should (eql (ert--mismatch '(a b c) '(a b d)) 2)))

   This test calls the function `ert--mismatch' several times with
various combinations of arguments and compares the return value to the
expected return value.  (Some programmers prefer `(should (eql EXPECTED
ACTUAL))' over the `(should (eql ACTUAL EXPECTED))' shown here.  ERT
works either way.)

   Here's a more complicated test:

     (ert-deftest ert-test-record-backtrace ()
       (let ((test (make-ert-test :body (lambda () (ert-fail "foo")))))
         (let ((result (ert-run-test test)))
           (should (ert-test-failed-p result))
           (with-temp-buffer
             (ert--print-backtrace (ert-test-failed-backtrace result))
             (goto-char (point-min))
             (end-of-line)
             (let ((first-line (buffer-substring-no-properties
                                (point-min) (point))))
               (should (equal first-line
                              "  signal(ert-test-failed (\"foo\"))")))))))

   This test creates a test object using `make-ert-test' whose body
will immediately signal failure.  It then runs that test and asserts
that it fails.  Then, it creates a temporary buffer and invokes
`ert--print-backtrace' to print the backtrace of the failed test to the
current buffer.  Finally, it extracts the first line from the buffer
and asserts that it matches what we expect.  It uses
`buffer-substring-no-properties' and `equal' to ignore text properties;
for a test that takes properties into account, `buffer-substring' and
`ert-equal-including-properties' could be used instead.

   The reason why this test only checks the first line of the backtrace
is that the remainder of the backtrace is dependent on ERT's internals
as well as whether the code is running interpreted or compiled.  By
looking only at the first line, the test checks a useful property--that
the backtrace correctly captures the call to `signal' that results from
the call to `ert-fail'--without being brittle.

   This example also shows that writing tests is much easier if the code
under test was structured with testing in mind.

   For example, if `ert-run-test' accepted only symbols that name tests
rather than test objects, the test would need a name for the failing
test, which would have to be a temporary symbol generated with
`make-symbol', to avoid side effects on Emacs's state.  Choosing the
right interface for `ert-run-tests' allows the test to be simpler.

   Similarly, if `ert--print-backtrace' printed the backtrace to a
buffer with a fixed name rather than the current buffer, it would be
much harder for the test to undo the side effect.  Of course, some code
somewhere needs to pick the buffer name.  But that logic is independent
of the logic that prints backtraces, and keeping them in separate
functions allows us to test them independently.

   A lot of code that you will encounter in Emacs was not written with
testing in mind.  Sometimes, the easiest way to write tests for such
code is to restructure the code slightly to provide better interfaces
for testing.  Usually, this makes the interfaces easier to use as well.

4.1 Understanding Explanations
==============================

Failed `should' forms are reported like this:

     F addition-test
         (ert-test-failed
          ((should
            (=
             (+ 1 2)
             4))
           :form
           (= 3 4)
           :value nil))

   ERT shows what the `should' expression looked like and what values
its subexpressions had: The source code of the assertion was `(should
(= (+ 1 2) 4))', which applied the function `=' to the arguments `3'
and `4', resulting in the value `nil'.  In this case, the test is
wrong; it should expect 3 rather than 4.

   If a predicate like `equal' is used with `should', ERT provides a
so-called _explanation_:

     F list-test
         (ert-test-failed
          ((should
            (equal
             (list 'a 'b 'c)
             '(a b d)))
           :form
           (equal
            (a b c)
            (a b d))
           :value nil :explanation
           (list-elt 2
                     (different-atoms c d))))

   In this case, the function `equal' was applied to the arguments `(a
b c)' and `(a b d)'.  ERT's explanation shows that the item at index 2
differs between the two lists; in one list, it is the atom c, in the
other, it is the atom d.

   In simple examples like the above, the explanation is unnecessary.
But in cases where the difference is not immediately apparent, it can
save time:

     F test1
         (ert-test-failed
          ((should
            (equal x y))
           :form
           (equal a a)
           :value nil :explanation
           (different-symbols-with-the-same-name a a)))

   ERT only provides explanations for predicates that have an
explanation function registered.  *Note Defining Explanation

4.2 Interactive Debugging
=========================

Debugging failed tests essentially works the same way as debugging any
other problems with Lisp code.  Here are a few tricks specific to tests:

   * Re-run the failed test a few times to see if it fails in the same
     way each time.  It's good to find out whether the behavior is
     deterministic before spending any time looking for a cause.  In the
     ERT results buffer, `r' re-runs the selected test.

   * Use `.' to jump to the source code of the test to find out exactly
     what it does.  Perhaps the test is broken rather than the code
     under test.

   * If the test contains a series of `should' forms and you can't tell
     which one failed, use `l', which shows you the list of all
     `should' forms executed during the test before it failed.

   * Use `b' to view the backtrace.  You can also use `d' to re-run the
     test with debugging enabled, this will enter the debugger and show
     the backtrace as well; but the top few frames shown there will not
     be relevant to you since they are ERT's own debugger hook.  `b'
     strips them out, so it is more convenient.

   * If the test or the code under testing prints messages using
     `message', use `m' to see what messages it printed before it
     failed.  This can be useful to figure out how far it got.

   * You can instrument tests for debugging the same way you instrument
     `defun's for debugging: go to the source code of the test and type
     `C-u C-M-x'.  Then, go back to the ERT buffer and re-run the test
     with `r' or `d'.

   * If you have been editing and rearranging tests, it is possible that
     ERT remembers an old test that you have since renamed or removed:
     renamings or removals of definitions in the source code leave
     around a stray definition under the old name in the running
     process (this is a common problem in Lisp).  In such a situation,
     hit `D' to let ERT forget about the obsolete test.

5 Extending ERT
***************

There are several ways to add functionality to ERT.

* Menu:

* Defining Explanation Functions::  Teach ERT about more predicates.
* Low-Level Functions for Working with Tests::  Use ERT's data for your purposes.


File: ert.info,  Node: Defining Explanation Functions,  Next: Low-Level Functions for Working with Tests,  Prev: Extending ERT,  Up: Extending ERT

5.1 Defining Explanation Functions
==================================

The explanation function for a predicate is a function that takes the
same arguments as the predicate and returns an _explanation_.  The
explanation should explain why the predicate, when invoked with the
arguments given to the explanation function, returns the value that it
returns.  The explanation can be any object but should have a
comprehensible printed representation.  If the return value of the
predicate needs no explanation for a given list of arguments, the
explanation function should return nil.

   To associate an explanation function with a predicate, add the
property `ert-explainer' to the symbol that names the predicate.  The
value of the property should be the symbol that names the explanation
function.


File: ert.info,  Node: Low-Level Functions for Working with Tests,  Prev: Defining Explanation Functions,  Up: Extending ERT

5.2 Low-Level Functions for Working with Tests
==============================================

Both `ert-run-tests-interactively' and `ert-run-tests-batch' are
implemented on top of the lower-level test handling code in the
sections of `ert.el' labeled "Facilities for running a single test",
"Test selectors", and "Facilities for running a whole set of tests".

   If you want to write code that works with ERT tests, you should take
a look at this lower-level code.  Symbols that start with `ert--' are
internal to ERT, whereas those that start with `ert-' are meant to be
usable by other code.  But there is no mature API yet.

   Contributions to ERT are welcome.

6 Other Testing Concepts
************************

For information on mocks, stubs, fixtures, or test suites, see below.

* Menu:

* Mocks and Stubs::           Stubbing out code that is irrelevant to the test.
* Fixtures and Test Suites::  How ERT differs from tools for other languages.


File: ert.info,  Node: Mocks and Stubs,  Next: Fixtures and Test Suites,  Prev: Other Testing Concepts,  Up: Other Testing Concepts

6.1 Other Tools for Emacs Lisp
==============================

Stubbing out functions or using so-called _mocks_ can make it easier to
write tests.  See `http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object' for an
explanation of the corresponding concepts in object-oriented languages.

   ERT does not have built-in support for mocks or stubs.  The package
`el-mock' (see `http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/el-mock.el') offers
mocks for Emacs Lisp and can be used in conjunction with ERT.


File: ert.info,  Node: Fixtures and Test Suites,  Prev: Mocks and Stubs,  Up: Other Testing Concepts

6.2 Fixtures and Test Suites
============================

In many ways, ERT is similar to frameworks for other languages like
SUnit or JUnit.  However, two features commonly found in such
frameworks are notably absent from ERT: fixtures and test suites.

   Fixtures are mainly used (e.g., in SUnit or JUnit) to provide an
environment for a set of tests, and consist of set-up and tear-down
functions.

   While fixtures are a useful syntactic simplification in other
languages, this does not apply to Lisp, where higher-order functions
and `unwind-protect' are available.  One way to implement and use a
fixture in ERT is

     (defun my-fixture (body)
       (unwind-protect
           (progn [set up]
                  (funcall body))
         [tear down]))

     (ert-deftest my-test ()
       (my-fixture
        (lambda ()
          [test code])))

   (Another way would be a `with-my-fixture' macro.)  This solves the
set-up and tear-down part, and additionally allows any test to use any
combination of fixtures, so it is more flexible than what other tools
typically allow.

   If the test needs access to the environment the fixture sets up, the
fixture can be modified to pass arguments to the body.

   These are well-known Lisp techniques.  Special syntax for them could
be added but would provide only a minor simplification.

   (If you are interested in such syntax, note that splitting set-up and
tear-down into separate functions, like *Unit tools usually do, makes
it impossible to establish dynamic `let' bindings as part of the
fixture.  So, blindly imitating the way fixtures are implemented in
other languages would be counter-productive in Lisp.)

   The purpose of test suites is to group related tests together.

   The most common use of this is to run just the tests for one
particular module.  Since symbol prefixes are the usual way of
separating module namespaces in Emacs Lisp, test selectors already
solve this by allowing regexp matching on test names; e.g., the
selector "^ert-" selects ERT's self-tests.

   Other uses include grouping tests by their expected execution time,
e.g., to run quick tests during interactive development and slow tests
less often.  This can be achieved with the `:tag' argument to
`ert-deftest' and `tag' test selectors.

Appendix A GNU Free Documentation License
*****************************************

                     Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

     Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008, 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     `http://fsf.org/'

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You
     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
     way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
     and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from
     you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and
     not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of
     the same material does not give you any rights to use it.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy
     can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

 11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
