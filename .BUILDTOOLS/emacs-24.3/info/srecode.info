SRecoder Manual
***************

SRecode is the Semantic Recoder.  Where Semantic will parse source
files into lists of tags, the Semantic Recoder will aid in converting
Semantic tags and various other information back into various types of
code.

   While the SRecode tool provides a template language, templates for
several languages, and even a sequence of heuristics that aid the user
in choosing a template to insert, this is not the main goal of SRecode.

   The goal of SRecode is to provide an application framework where
someone can write a complex code generator, and the underlying template
commonality allows it to work in multiple languages with ease.

1 Quick Start
*************

When you install CEDET and enable SRecode, an `SRecoder' menu item
should appear.

   To toggle SRecode minor mode on and off use:

     M-x srecode-minor-mode RET
   or
     M-x global-srecode-minor-mode RET

   or add

     (srecode-minor-mode 1)

   into a language hook function to force it on (which is the default)
or pass in `-1' to force it off.

   See *note SRecode Minor Mode:: for more on using the minor mode.

   Use the menu to insert templates into the current file.

   You can add your own templates in `~/.srecode', or update the
template map path:

 -- Option: srecode-map-load-path
     Global load path for SRecode template files.

   Once installed, you can start inserting templates using the menu, or
the command:

 -- Command: srecode-insert template-name &rest dict-entries
     Insert the template TEMPLATE-NAME into the current buffer at point.
     DICT-ENTRIES are additional dictionary values to add.

   SRecode Insert will prompt for a template name.  Template names are
specific to each major mode.  A typical name is of the form:
`CONTEXT:NAME' where a CONTEXT might be something like `file' or
`declaration'.  The same NAME can occur in multiple contexts.


File: srecode.info,  Node: User Templates,  Next: Parts of SRecode,  Prev: Quick Start,  Up: Top

2 User Templates
****************

SRecode builds and maintains a map of all template files.  The root
template files resides in the SRecode distribution.  User written
templates files are saved in `~/.srecode', along with the SRecode map
file.

 -- Variable: srecode-map-save-file
     The save location for SRecode's map file.

   Template files end with a `.srt' extension.  Details on how to write
templates are in *note Template Writing::.

   Each template file you write is dedicated to a single major mode.  In
it, you can write templates within the same context and with the same
name as core templates.  You can force your templates to override the
core templates for a particular major mode by setting the priority.
See *note Special Variables::.

   To get going quickly, open a new `.srt' file.  It will start in the
SRecode template writing mode.  Use the SRecode minor mode menu to
insert the `empty' file template.

   When using templates in other modes (such as C++ or Emacs Lisp
templates), use the "Edit Template" menu to find a template you would
like to update.  Copy it into your user template file, and change it.

   If you were to update `declaration:function' in your user template
file, then you would get this new template instead of the one that
comes with SRecode.  Higher level applications should always use
`declaration:function' when generating their own code, so higher level
templates will then adopt your changes to `declaration:function' into
themselves.

   You can also override variables.  Core variables are stored in the
SRecode root template file `default.srt', and that contains the
copyright usually used, and some basic file setup formats.  Override
variables like this by specifying a `mode' of `default' like this:

     set mode "default"

3 Parts of SRecode
******************

The SRecode system is made up of several layers which work together to
generate code.

3.1 Template Layer
==================

The template layer provides a way to write, and compile templates.  The
template layer is the scheme used to insert text into an Emacs buffer.

   The SRecode template layer is more advanced than other modes like the
Emacs packages `skeleton' or `tempo' in that it allows multiple layers
of templates to be created with the same names.  This means that
SRecode can provide a wide range of templates, and users can override
only the small sections they want, instead of either accepting someone
else's template, or writing large new templates of their own.

   Templates are written in `.srt' files.  You can learn how to author
new `.srt' files *note Template Writing::.

   While the template system was designed for SRecode based
applications it can also be used independently for simple template
insertion during typical coding.

3.2 Template Manager
====================

Once templates have been written, a scheme for loading and selecting
templates is needed.  The template manager has a loader for finding
template files, and determining which templates are relevant to the
current buffer.  Template files are sorted by priority, with user
templates being found first, and system level default templates last.
Templates are also sorted by application.  Each application has its own
templates, and are kept seperate from the generic templates.

3.3 Dictionary
==============

Dictionaries contain values associated with variable.  Variables are
used in macros in a template.  Variables are what allows a generic
template such as a function to be made specific, such as a function
named foo.  The value of a variable can be one of three things; a
string, a list of more dictionaries, or a special
`srecode-dictionary-compound-value' object subclass.  See *note
Variables:: for more.

3.4 Template Insertion
======================

The template insertion layer involves extensions to the basic template
layer.  A wide range of custom variables are available for mixing
derived data as macros into the plain text of a template.

   In addition, templates can be declared with arguments.  These
arguments represent predetermined sets of dictionary values, such as
features of the current file name, user name, time, etc.

   Some arguments are major-mode specific, such as the `:el' or `:cpp'
arguments.

3.5 Template Insertion Context
==============================

A context can be provided for templates in a file.  This helps
auto-selection of templates by name, or allows templates in different
contexts to have the same name.  Some standard contexts are `file',
`declaration', and `classdecl'.

   A context can be automatically derived as well based on the parsing
state from Semantic.  *note Semantic Manual: (semantic)Top.

3.6 Applications
================

Commands that do a particular user task which involves also writing
Emacs Lisp code.  Applications are at the top layer.  These
applications have their own template files and logic needed to fill in
dictionaries or position a cursor.  SRecode comes with an example
`srecode-document' application for creating comments for Semantic tags.
The CEDET application EDE has a project type that is an SRecode
application.

3.7 Field Editing
=================

If the variable `srecode-insert-ask-variable-method' is set to 'field,
then variables that would normally ask a question, will instead create
"fields" in the buffer.  A field-editing layer provides simple
interaction through the fields.  Typing in a field will cause all
variable locations that are the same to edit at the same time.
Pressing TAB on a field will move you to the next field.


File: srecode.info,  Node: SRecode Minor Mode,  Next: Template Writing,  Prev: Parts of SRecode,  Up: Top

4 SRecode Minor Mode
********************

The Semantic Recode minor mode enables a keymap and menu that provides
simple access to different templates or template applications.

   The key prefix is <C-c />.

   If the variable `srecode-takeover-INS-key' is set, then the key
<<insert>> can also be used.

   The most important key is bound to `srecode-insert' which is <C-c /
/>, or <insert insert>.  *note Quick Start::.

   Major keybindings are:

<C-c / />
     Insert a template whose name is typed into the minibuffer.

<C-c / <lower case letter>>
     Reserved for direct binding of simple templates to keys using a
     keybinding command in the template file.

<C-c / <upper case letter>>
     Reserved for template applications (Such as comment or get/set
     inserter.)

<C-c / E>
     Edit the code of a template.

<C-c / .>
     Insert template again.  This will cause the previously inserted
     template to be inserted again.

4.1 Field Editing
=================

By default, when inserting a template, if the user needs to enter text
to fill in a part of the template, then the minibuffer is used to query
for that information.  SRecode also supports a field-edting mode that
can be used instead.  To enable it set:

 -- Function: srecode-insert-ask-variable-method
     Determine how to ask for a dictionary value when inserting a
     template.  Only the ASK style inserter will query the user for a
     value.  Dictionary value references that ask begin with the ?
     character.  Possible values are:
    `ask'
          Prompt in the minibuffer as the value is inserted.

    `field'
          Use the dictionary macro name as the inserted value, and
          place a field there.  Matched fields change together.

     NOTE: The field feature does not yet work with XEmacs.

   Field editing mode is supported in newer versions of Emacs.  You
will not be prompted to fill in values while the template is inserted.
Instead, short regions will be highlighted, and the cursor placed in a
field.  Typing in the field will then fill in the value.  Several
fields might be linked together.  In that case, typing in one area will
modify the other linked areas.  Pressing TAB will move between editable
fields in the template.

   Once the cursor moves out of the are inserted by the template, all
the fields are cancelled.

   NOTE: Some conveniences in templates, such as completion, or
character restrictins are lost when using field editing mode.

5 Template Writing
******************

`srecode-template-mode' is the major mode used for designing new
templates.  SRecode files (Extension `.srt') are made up of variable
settings and template declarations.

   Here is an overview of the terminology you will need for the next few
sections:

template file
     A file with a `.srt' extension which contains settings, variables,
     and templates.

template
     One named entity which represents a block of text that will be
     inserted.  The text is compiled into a sequence of insertable
     entities.  The entities are string constants, and macros.

macro
     A macro is a text sequence within template text that is replaced
     with some other value.

dictionary
     A table of variable names and values.

subdictionary
     A dictionary that is subordinate under another dictionary as a
     value to some variable.

variable
     A variable is an entry in a dictionary which has a value.

File: srecode.info,  Node: Variables,  Next: Templates,  Up: Template Writing

5.1 Variables
=============

Variables can be set up and used in templates.  Many variables you may
use are set up via template arguments, but some may be preferences a
user can set up that are used in system templates.

   When expanding a template, variables are stored in a "dictionary".
Dictionary entries are variables.  Variables defined in templates can
have string like values.

   A variable can be set like this:
     set VARNAME "some value"

   Note that a VARIABLE is a name in a dictionary that can be used in a
MACRO in a template.  The macro referernces some variable by name.

* Compound Variable Values:: Compound Variable Values


File: srecode.info,  Node: String Values,  Next: Multi-string Values,  Up: Variables

5.1.1 String Values
-------------------

Variables can be set to strings.  Strings may contain newlines or any
other characters.  Strings are interpreted by the Emacs Lisp reader so
`\n', `\t', and `\"' work.

   When a string is inserted as part of a template, nothing within the
string is interperted, such as template escape characters.


File: srecode.info,  Node: Multi-string Values,  Next: Section Show,  Prev: String Values,  Up: Variables

5.1.2 Multi-string Values
-------------------------

A variable can be set to multiple strings.  A compound value is usually
used when you want to use dictionary entries as part of a variable
later on.

   Multi-string variable values are set like string values except there
are more than one.  For example

     set NAME "this" "-mode"

   These two strings will be concatenated together.

   A more useful thing is to include dictionary variables and
concatenate those into the string.  Use the "macro" keyword to include
the name of a variable.  This is like macros in a template.  For
example:

     set NAME macro "MODE" "-mode"

   will extract the value of the dictionary variable MODE and append
"-mode" to the end.


File: srecode.info,  Node: Section Show,  Next: Special Variables,  Prev: Multi-string Values,  Up: Variables

5.1.3 Section Show
------------------

To set a variable to show a template section, use the `show' command.
Sections are blocks of a template wrapped in section macros.  If there
is a section macro using NAME it will be shown for each dictionary
associated with the NAME macro.

     show NAME

   This will enable that section.

   NOTE: May 11, 2008: I haven't used this yet, so I don't know if it
works.


File: srecode.info,  Node: Special Variables,  Next: Automatic Loop Variables,  Prev: Section Show,  Up: Variables

5.1.4 Special Variables
-----------------------

Some variables have special meaning that changes attributes when
templates are compiled, including:

`escape-start'
     This is the character sequence that escapes from raw text to
     template macro names.  The ability to change the escape characters
     are key for enabling SRecode templates to work across many kinds
     of languages.

`escape-end'
     This is the character sequence that escapes the end of a template
     macro name.

     Example:
          set escape_start "$"
          set escape_end "$"

`mode'
     This is the major mode, as a string with the full Emacs Lisp
     symbol in it.  All templates in this file will be installed into
     the template table for this major mode.

     Multiple template files can use the same mode, and all those
     templates will be available in buffers of that mode.

     Example:
          set mode "emacs-lisp-mode"

`priority'
     The priority of a file is a number in a string constant that
     indicates where it lies in the template search order.  System
     templates default to low priority numbers.  User templates default
     to high priority numbers.  You can specify the priority of your
     template to insert it anywhere in the template search list.

     If there are multiple templates with the same context and name, the
     template with the highest priority number will be used.

     If multiple files have the same priority, then then sort order is
     unpredictable.  If no template names match, then it doesn't matter.

     Example:
          set priority "35"

`application'
     If a template file contains templates only needed for a particular
     application, then specify an application.  Template files for an
     application are stored in the template repository, but are not
     used in the generic template insertion case.

     The application with a particular name will access these templates
     from Lisp code.

     Example:
          set application "document"

`project'
     If a template file contains templates, or template overrides
     specific to a set of files under a particular directory, then that
     template file can specify a "project" that it belongs to.

     Set the "project" special variable to a directory name.  Only files
     under that directory will be able to access the templates in that
     file.

     Any template file that has a project specified will get have a
     priority that is set between SRecode base templates, and user
     defined templates.

     Templates can be compiled via a project system, such as EDE.  EDE
     loaded templates will get a PROJECT set automatically.

     Example:
          set project "/tmp/testproject"


   If you need to insert the characters that belong to the variables
`escape_start' or `escape_end', then place those into a variable.  For
example

     set escape_start "$"
     set escape_end "$"
     set DOLLAR "$"


File: srecode.info,  Node: Automatic Loop Variables,  Next: Compound Variable Values,  Prev: Special Variables,  Up: Variables

5.1.5 Automatic Loop Variables
------------------------------

When section macros are used, that section is repeated for each
subdictionary bound to the loop variable.

   Each dictionary added will automatically get values for positional
macros which will enable different SECTIONS.  The automatic section
variables are.

   * FIRST--The first entry in the table.

   * NOTFIRST--Not the first entry in the table.

   * LAST--The last entry in the table

   * NOTLAST--Not the last entry in the table.


File: srecode.info,  Node: Compound Variable Values,  Prev: Automatic Loop Variables,  Up: Variables

5.1.6 Compound Variable Values
------------------------------

A variable can also have a compound value.  This means the value of the
variable is an EIEIO object, which is a subclass of
`srecode-dictionary-compound-value'.

   New compound variables can only be setup from Lisp code.  See *note
Compound Dictionary Values:: for details on setting up compound
variables from Lisp.


File: srecode.info,  Node: Templates,  Next: Contexts,  Prev: Variables,  Up: Template Writing

5.2 Templates
=============

A template represents a text pattern that can be inserted into a buffer.

   A basic template is declaired like this:

     template TEMPLATENAME :arg1 :arg2
     "Optional documentation string"
     ----
     The text to your template goes here.
     ----
     bind "a"

   Templates are stored in a template table by name, and are inserted by
the TEMPLATENAME provided.

   The documentation string is optional.  This documentation string will
be used to aid users in selecting which template they want to use.

   The code that makes up the raw template occurs between the lines that
contain the text "----".

* Menu:

* Template Section Dictionaries::  Template Scoped Macro values
* Template Macros::     Macros occuring in template patterns


File: srecode.info,  Node: Template Section Dictionaries,  Next: Template Macros,  Up: Templates

5.2.1 Template Section Dictionaries
-----------------------------------

To add variable values to section dictionaries used within a specific
template, you can add them to the beginning of the template declaration
like this:

     template TEMPLATENAME :arg1 :arg2
     "Optional documentation string"
     sectiondictionary "A"
     set NAME "foo"
     ----
     A beginning line {{NAME}}
     {{#A}}Optional string {{NAME}} here{{/A}}
     An end line
     ----

   In this example, the NAME variable gets the value "foo", but only
while it is inside section macro A.  The outer scoped NAME will be
empty.

   This is particularly useful while using an include macro to pull in a
second template.  In this way, you can pass values known from one
template to a subordinate template where some value is not known.

   From the Emacs Lisp default template file, a syntax table is just a
variable with a specialized value.

   If a variable is declared like this (where $ is the escape
character):

     template variable :el
     "Insert a variable.
     DOC is optional."
     ----
     (defvar $?NAME$ $^$
       "$DOC$")
     ----

   then you can see that there is a NAME and DOC that is needed.  The
`^' point inserter is also a handy key here.

   The syntax table wants a variable, but knows the values of some of
these variables, and can recast the problem like this by using template
specific `sectiondictionary' macro declarations.

     template syntax-table
     "Create a syntax table."
     sectiondictionary "A"
     set NAME macro "?MODESYM" "-mode-syntax-table"
     set DOC "Syntax table used in " macro "?MODESYM" " buffers."
     ----
     $<A:variable$
       (let ((table (make-syntax-table (standard-syntax-table))))
         (modify-syntax-entry ?\; ". 12"  table) ;; SEMI, Comment start ;;
         ;; ...
         table)
     $/A$
     ----

   In this way, NAME can be set as a user posed question for MODESYM
with "-mode-syntax-table" appended.  A simplified doc string will also
be inserted.

   Lastly, the A section contains more macro text which is inserted at
the `^' point marker.

   By creating useful base templates for things like function or
variable declarations, and recycling them in higher-order templates, an
end user can override the basic declarator, and the higher order
templates will then obey the new format, or perhaps even work in more
than one major mode.


File: srecode.info,  Node: Template Macros,  Prev: Template Section Dictionaries,  Up: Templates

5.2.2 Template Macros
---------------------

Template macros occur in the template text.  The default escape
characters are "{{" and "}}", though they can be changed in the
top-level variables.  See *note Variables::.

   Thus, if you have the template code that looks like this:

     ;; Author: {{AUTHOR}}

   Then the text between {{ and }} are a macro, and substituted by the
value of the variable AUTHOR.

   Macros can be specialized to be more than just a text string.  For
example, the macro above could be augmented with an Emacs Lisp function.

     ;; Author: {{AUTHOR:upcase}}

   In this case, the Emacs Lisp function `upcase' will be called on the
text value of the AUTHOR variable.

   Macros can also be specialized to have different behaviors by using a
prefix, non-alpha character or symbol.  For example:

     {{! This is a comment inside macro escape characters }}

   shows that the "!" symbol is for comments.

   Alternately, a macro could query the user during insertion:

     (defun {{?NAME}} ()
        {{^}}
        ) ;; End of {{NAME}}

   the "?" symbol indicates that if the symbol NAME isn't in the
dictionary, then the user should be queried for the NAME variable.  If
NAME appears again in the template, the original value specified by the
user will be inserted again.

   If the text from a dictionary value is to be placed in column format,
you can use the "|" symbol to indicate you want column control.  For
example:

        | this | that |{{#A}}
        | {{|THIS:4}} | {{|THAT:4}} |{{/A}}

   For each repeated section "#A" the dictionary values for THIS and
THAT will be inserted and either trimmed to, or expanded to 4
characters in width.

   Macros that are prefixed with the "#" symbol denote a section.  A
macro of the same name with a "/" prefix denotes the end of that
section.

     {{#MOOSE}}
     Here is some text describing moose.
     {{/MOOSE}}

   In this example if the section MOOSE was "shown" in the active
dictionary, then the text between the # and / macros will also be
inserted.

   All the text and macros within a section are either not shown at all
(if that section is not 'visible') or the section is shown one time for
each dictionary added to that symbol.  *Note Developing Template
Functions::.

   Macros prefixed with ">" will include another template.  Include
macros would look like this:

     {{>FOO:defun}}

   where `FOO' is the dictionary variable for the sub-dictionary used
for expanding the template `defun'.  The `defun' template will be
looked up in the template repository for the current mode, or in any
inherited modes.

   Another way to include another template is with an include macro that
will also wrap section text.  The includewrap insertion method looks
like this:

     {{<FOO:defun}}Handy Text goes here{{/FOO}}

   In this case, `defun' is included just as above.  If the `defun'
template has a {{^}} macro in it, then the section text "Handy Text
goes here" will be inserted at that point, and that location will not
be saved as the cursor location.

   If there is no {{^}}, then the text will not be inserted.

   For both kinds of include macros, you may need to include a template
from a different context.  You can use `:' separate the context from
the name, like this:

     {{>FOO:declaration:function}}


File: srecode.info,  Node: Contexts,  Next: Prompts,  Prev: Templates,  Up: Template Writing

5.3 Context
===========

Each template belongs to a context.  When promting for a template by
name, such as with `C-c / /', the name is prefixed by the current
context.  If there is no context, it defaults to `declaration'.

   You can change context like this:

     context NAME

   where NAME is some symbol that represents any context.

   A context resides over all templates that come after it until the
next context statement.  Thus:

     context C1

     template foo
     "Foo template in C1"
     ----
     ----

     context C2

     temlate foo
     "Foo template in C2"
     ----
     ----

   creates two `foo' templates.  The first one is when in context C1.
The second is available in context C2.

   This is useful if there are multiple ways to declare something like a
function or variable that differ only by where it is in the syntax of
the lanugage.  The name `foo' is not ambiguous because each is in a
different context.

5.4 Prompt
==========

Some templates use promtping macro insertion.  A macro that needs a
prompt looks like this:

     {{?NAME}}

   where ? comes after the first escape character.

   by default, it will use a prompt like this when it is encountered:

     Specify NAME:

   For such macros, you can pre-define prompts for any dictionary entry.
When that dictionary entry is first encountered, the user is prompted,
and subsequent occurances of that dictionary entry use the same value.

   To get a different prompt, use a prompt command like this:

     prompt VARNAME "Nice Way to ask for VARNAME: "

   Now, if you put this in a template:

     template variable
     ----
     (defvar {{?VARNAME}} nil
        "")
     ----

   when VARNAME is encountered, it will use the nice prompt.

   Prompts can be extended as well.  For example:

     prompt VARNAME "VARNAME: " default "srecode" read y-or-n-p

   In this case, the `default' keyword indicates that `"srecode"' is
the default string to use, and `y-or-n-p' is the function to use to ask
the question.

   For `y-or-n-p' if you type "y" it inserts the default string,
otherwise it inserts empty.

   For any other symbol that occurs after the `read' token, it is
expected to take the same argument list as `read-string'.  As such, you
can create your own prompts that do completing reads on deterministic
values.

   To have the default be calculated later from a dictionary entry, you
need to use the `defaultmacro' keyword instead.

     prompt VARNAME "Varname: " defaultmacro "PREFIX"

   now, when it attempts to read in VARNAME, it will pre-populte the
text editing section with whatever the value of PREFIX is.

   Some language arguments may supply possible prefixes for prompts.
Look for these when creating your prompts.

6 Dictionaries
**************

Dictionaries are a set of variables.  The values associated with the
variable names could be anything, but how it is handled is dependent on
the type of macro being inserted.

   Most of this chapter is for writing Lisp programs that use SRecode.
If you only want to write template files, then you only need to read
the *note Template Argument Dictionary Entries:: section.

File: srecode.info,  Node: Create a Dictionary,  Next: Setting Dictionary Values,  Up: Dictionaries

6.1 Create a Dictionary
=======================

 -- Function: srecode-create-dictionary &optional buffer
     Create a dictionary for BUFFER.  If BUFFER is not specified, use
     the current buffer.  The dictionary is initialized with no
     variables or enabled sections.  Any variables defined with `set'
     in the template, however, becomes a name in the dictionary.


File: srecode.info,  Node: Setting Dictionary Values,  Next: Compound Dictionary Values,  Prev: Create a Dictionary,  Up: Dictionaries

6.2 Setting Dictionary Values
=============================

When building an SRecode based application, you will need to setup your
dictionary values yourself.  There are several utility functions for
this.

   In the simplest form, you can assocate a string with a variable.

 -- Function: srecode-dictionary-set-value dict name value
     In dictionary DICT, set NAME to have VALUE.

   For section macros, you can have alternate values.  A section can
either be toggled as visible, or it can act as a loop.

 -- Function: srecode-dictionary-show-section dict name
     In dictionary DICT, indicate that the section NAME should be
     exposed.

 -- Function: srecode-dictionary-add-section-dictionary dict name
          show-only
     In dictionary DICT, add a section dictionary for section macro
     NAME.  Return the new dictionary.

     You can add several dictionaries to the same section entry.  For
     each dictionary added to a variable, the block of codes in the
     template will be repeated.

     If optional argument SHOW-ONLY is non-`nil', then don't add a new
     dictionarly if there is already one in place.  Also, don't add
     FIRST/LAST entries.  These entries are not needed when we are just
     showing a section.

     Each dictionary added will automatically get values for positional
     macros which will enable SECTIONS to be enabled.

    FIRST
          The first entry in the table.

    NOTFIRST
          Not the first entry in the table.

    LAST
          The last entry in the table

    NOTLAST
          Not the last entry in the table.

     Adding a new dictionary will alter these values in previously
     inserted dictionaries.


File: srecode.info,  Node: Compound Dictionary Values,  Next: Argument Resolution,  Prev: Setting Dictionary Values,  Up: Dictionaries

6.3 Compound Dictionary Values
==============================

If you want to associate a non-string value with a dictionary variable,
then you will need to use a compound value.  Compound dictionary values
are derived using EIEIO from a base class for handling arbitrary data
in a macro.

 -- Type: srecode-dictionary-compound-value
     A compound dictionary value.  Values stored in a dictionary must
     be a STRING, a dictionary for showing sections, or an instance of
     a subclass of this class.

     Compound dictionary values derive from this class, and must
     provide a sequence of method implementations to convert into a
     string.

   Your new subclass of the compound value needs to implement these
methods:

 -- Function: srecode-compound-toString cp function dictionary
     Convert the compound dictionary value CP to a string.  If FUNCTION
     is non-`nil', then FUNCTION is somehow applied to an aspect of the
     compound value.  The FUNCTION could be a fraction of some function
     symbol with a logical prefix excluded.

   The next method is for dumping out tables during debugging.

 -- Function: srecode-dump cp &optional indent
     Display information about this compound value.

   Here is an example of wrapping a semantic tag in a compound value:

     (defclass srecode-semantic-tag (srecode-dictionary-compound-value)
       ((prime :initarg :prime
               :type semantic-tag
               :documentation
               "This is the primary insertion tag.")
        )
       "Wrap up a collection of semantic tag information.
     This class will be used to derive dictionary values.")

     (defmethod srecode-compound-toString((cp srecode-semantic-tag)
                                          function
                                          dictionary)
       "Convert the compound dictionary value CP to a string.
     If FUNCTION is non-nil, then FUNCTION is somehow applied to an
     aspect of the compound value."
       (if (not function)
           ;; Just format it in some handy dandy way.
           (semantic-format-tag-prototype (oref cp :prime))
         ;; Otherwise, apply the function to the tag itself.
         (funcall function (oref cp :prime))
         ))


File: srecode.info,  Node: Argument Resolution,  Next: Creating new Arguments,  Prev: Compound Dictionary Values,  Up: Dictionaries

6.4 Argument Resolution
=======================

Some dictionary entries can be set via template arguments in the
template declaration.  For examples of template arguments, see *note
Template Argument Dictionary Entries::.

   You can resolve an argument list into a dictionary with:

 -- Function: srecode-resolve-arguments temp dict
     Resolve all the arguments needed by the template TEMP.  Apply
     anything learned to the dictionary DICT.


File: srecode.info,  Node: Creating new Arguments,  Next: Querying a Dictionary,  Prev: Argument Resolution,  Up: Dictionaries

6.5 Creating new Arguments
==========================

You can create new arguments for use in template files by writing new
Emacs Lisp functions.  Doing so is easy.  Here is an example for the
`:user' argument:

     (defun srecode-semantic-handle-:user (dict)
       "Add macros into the dictionary DICT based on the current :user."
       (srecode-dictionary-set-value dict "AUTHOR" (user-full-name))
       (srecode-dictionary-set-value dict "LOGIN" (user-login-name))
        ;; ...
       )

   In this case, a function with the name prefix
`srecode-semantic-handle-' that ends in `:user' creates a new argument
`:user' that can be used in a template.

   Your argument handler must take one argument DICT, which is the
dictionary to fill in.  Inside your function, you can do whatever you
want, but adding dictionary values is the right thing.


File: srecode.info,  Node: Querying a Dictionary,  Next: Template Argument Dictionary Entries,  Prev: Creating new Arguments,  Up: Dictionaries

6.6 Querying a Dictionary
=========================

When creating a new argument, it may be useful to ask the dicitonary
what entries are already set there, and conditionally create new
entries based on those.

   In this way, a template author can get additional logic through more
advanced arguments.

 -- Function: srecode-dictionary-lookup-name dict name
     Return information about the current DICT's value for NAME.  DICT
     is a dictionary, and NAME is a string that is the name of a symbol
     in the dictionary.  This function derives values for some special
     NAMEs, such as FIRST and 'LAST'.


File: srecode.info,  Node: Template Argument Dictionary Entries,  Prev: Querying a Dictionary,  Up: Dictionaries

6.7 Template Argument Dictionary Entries
========================================

When a dictionary is initialized for a template, then the dictionary
will be initialized with a predefined set of macro values.

   A template of the form:

     template template-name :arg1 :arg2
     ----
     Your template goes here
     ----

   specifies two arguments :arg1, and :arg2.

   The following built-in simple arguments are available:

* Menu:

* Base Arguments::
* Semantic Arguments::
* Language Arguments::


File: srecode.info,  Node: Base Arguments,  Next: Semantic Arguments,  Up: Template Argument Dictionary Entries

6.7.1 Base Arguments
--------------------

6.7.1.1 Argument :indent
........................

Supplies the `INDENT' macro.  When `INDENT' is non-nil, then each line
is individually indented with `indent-according-to-mode' during macro
processing.

6.7.1.2 Argument :blank
.......................

Specifying this argument adds a special `:blank' handler at the
beginning and end of the template.  This handler will insert `\n' if
the insertion point is not on a line by itself.

6.7.1.3 Argument :region
........................

If there is an active region via `transient-mark-mode', or
`mouse-drag-region', then the `REGION' section will be enabled.

   In addition, `REGIONTEXT' will be set the the text in the region,
and that region of text will be "killed" from the current buffer.

   If standard-output is NOT the current buffer, then the region will
not be deleted.  In this way, you can safely use `:region' using
templates in arbitrary output streams.

6.7.1.4 Argument :user
......................

Sets up variables about the current user.

`AUTHOR'
     Value of the Emacs function `user-full-name'

`EMAIL'
     Current Emacs user's email address.

`LOGIN'
     Current Emacs user's login name.

`UID'
     Current Emacs user's login ID.

`EMACSINITFILE'
     This Emacs sessions' init file.

6.7.1.5 Argument :time
......................

Sets up variables with the current date and time.

`YEAR'
     The current year.

`MONTH'
     The current month as a number.

`MONTHNAME'
     The current month name, unabbreviated.

`DAY'
     The current day as a number.

`WEEKDAY'
     The current day of the week as an abbreviated name

`HOUR'
     The current hour in 24 hour format.

`HOUR12'
     The current hour in 12 hour format.

`AMPM'
     Locale equivalent of AM or PM.  Usefule with HOUR12.

`MINUTE'
     The current minute.

`SECOND'
     The current second.

`TIMEZONE'
     The timezone string.

`DATE'
     The Locale supported date (%D).

`TIME'
     The Locale supported time format (%X).

6.7.1.6 Argument :file
......................

Sets up variables with details about the current file.

`FILENAME'
     The filename without the directory part of the current buffer.

`FILE'
     The filename without the directory or extension

`EXTENSION'
     The filename extension.

`DIRECTORY'
     The directory in which the current buffer resides.

`MODE'
     Major mode of this buffer.

`SHORTMODE'
     Major mode of this buffer without "-mode".  Useful for inserting
     the Emacs mode specifier.

`section RCS'
     Show the section RCS if there is a CVS or RCS directory here.

6.7.1.7 Argument :system
........................

Sets up variables with computer system information.

`SYSTEMCONF'
     The "system-configuration".

`SYSTEMTYPE'
     The "system-type".

`SYSTEMNAME'
     The "system-name".

`MAILHOST'
     The name of the machine Emacs derived mail "comes from".

6.7.1.8 Argument :kill
......................

`KILL'
     The top-most item from the kill ring.

`KILL2'
     The second item in the kill ring.

`KILL3'
     The third item in the kill ring.

`KILL4'
     The fourth item in the kill ring.

6.7.2 Semantic Arguments
------------------------

6.7.2.1 Argument :tag
.....................

The :tag argument is filled in with information from Semantic.  The tag
in question is queried from the senator tag ring, or passed in from
SRecode utilities that use tags in templates.

`TAG'
     This is a compound value for the tag in the current senator kill
     ring, or something handled via the variable
     `srecode-semantic-selected-tag'.

      -- Variable: srecode-semantic-selected-tag
          The tag selected by a `:tag' template argument.  If this is
          `nil', then `senator-tag-ring' is used.

     Use the function part of a macro insert to extract obscure parts
     of the tag.

`NAME'
     The name of the tag as a string.

`TYPE'
     The data type of the tag as a string.

   If TAG is a function, you will get these additional dictionary
entries.

`ARGS'
     A Loop macro value.  Each argument is inserted in ARGS.  To create
     a comma separated list of arguments, you might do this:

          {{#ARGS}}{{TYPE}} {{NAME}}{{#NOTLAST}},{{/NOTLAST}}{{/ARGS}}

     Within the section dictionaries for each argument, you will find
     both NAME and TYPE, in addition to the automatic section values
     for FIRST, LAST, NOTFIRST, and NOTLAST.

`PARENT'
     The string name of the parent of this function, if the function is
     a method of some class.

`THROWS'
     In each THROWS entry, the NAME of the signal thrown is specified.

   If TAG is a variable, you will get these dictionary entries.

`DEFAULTVALUE'
     Enabled if there is a VALUE.

`VALUE'
     An entry in the HAVEDEFAULT subdictionary that represents the
     textual representation of the default value of this variable.

   If TAG is a datatype, you will get these dictionary entries.

`PARENTS'
     Section dictionaries for the parents of this class.  Each parent
     will have a NAME.

`INTERFACES'
     Section dictionaries for all the implemented interfaces of this
     class.  Each interface will have a NAME.

   Note that data type templates should always have a `{{^}}' macro in
it where the core contents of that type will go.  This is why data
types don't have subdictionaries full of the slots in the classes or
structs.


File: srecode.info,  Node: Language Arguments,  Prev: Semantic Arguments,  Up: Template Argument Dictionary Entries

6.7.3 language Arguments
------------------------

Each language typically has its own argument.  These arguments can be
used to fill in language specific values that will be useful.

6.7.3.1 Argument :srt
.....................

Used for SRecoder template files.

`ESCAPE_START'
     The characters used for an escape start

`ESCAPE_END'
     The characters used for an escape end

6.7.3.2 Argument :cpp
.....................

`HEADER'
     Shows this section if the current file is a header file.

`NOTHEADER'
     The opposite of `HEADER'.

`FILENAME_SYMBOL'
     The current filename reformatted as a C friendly symbol.

6.7.4 Argument :java
--------------------

`FILENAME_AS_PACKAGE'
     Converts the filename into text that would be suitable as a package
     name.

`FILENAME_AS_CLASS'
     Converts the filename into text that would be suitable as a
     class-name for the main class in the file.

`CURRENT_PACKAGE'
     Finds the occurance of "package" and gets its value.

6.7.4.1 Argument :el
....................

Sets `PRENAME'.  This would be a common prefix from all the tags in the
current buffer.

   Most Emacs Lisp packages have some common prefix used in a way
similar to namespaces in other languages.

6.7.4.2 Argument :el-custom
...........................

`GROUP'
     The name of the Emacs Custom group that instances of `defcustom'
     ought to use.

`FACEGROUP'
     The name of the Emacs Custom group that faces delcared with
     `defface' ought to use.

6.7.4.3 Argument :texi
......................

`LEVEL'
     The current section level, such as `chapter' or `section'.

`NEXTLEVEL'
     The next level down, so if `LEVEL' is `chapter', then `NEXTLEVEL'
     would be `section'.

6.7.4.4 Argument :texitag
.........................

The `:texitag' argument is like the `:tag' argument, except that
additional variable `TAGDOC' is provided for each tag.

   The `TAGDOC' is filled with derived documentation from the tag in
question, and that documentation is also reformatted to be mostly
texinfo compatible.

6.7.5 Argument :android
-----------------------

The `:android' argument pulls in information from your current project.

   @TODO - add more here.

7 Developing Template Functions
*******************************

You can develop your own custom template insertion functions.  Doing so
is relatively simple, and requires that you write an Emacs Lisp command.

   If the built in commands don't provide enough options, you will need
to write your own function in order to provide your dictionaries with
the values needed for custom templates.

   In this way, you can build your own code generator for any language
based on a set of predefined macros whos values you need to derive from
Emacs Lisp code yourself.

   For example:

     (defun my-srecode-insert (template-name)
       "Insert the template TEMPLATE-NAME into the current buffer at point."

       ;; Read in a template name.
       (interactive (list (srecode-read-template-name "Template Name: ")))
       (if (not (srecode-table))
           (error "No template table found for mode %s" major-mode))
       (let ((temp (srecode-template-get-table (srecode-table) template-name))

            ;; Create a new dictionary
     	(newdict (srecode-create-dictionary)))

         (if (not temp)
             (error "No Template named %s" template-name))

         ;; Add some values into the dictionary!
         (srecode-dictionary-set-value newdict "FOO" (my-get-value-of-foo))
         ;; Optionally show a section
         (srecode-dictionary-show-section newdict "BLARG")

         ;; Add in several items over a loop
         (let ((my-stuff (get-my-stuff-list)))
            (while my-stuff
               (let ((subdict (srecode-dictionary-add-section-dictionary
                                  newdict "LOOP")))
                  (srecode-dictionary-set-value subdict "NAME" (nth 0 my-stuff))
                  (srecode-dictionary-set-value subdict "ARG" (nth 1 my-stuff))
                  (srecode-dictionary-set-value subdict "MOOSE" (nth 2 my-stuff))
                  )
               (setq my-stuff (cdr my-stuff)))

         ;; Some templates have arguments that need to be resolved.
         (srecode-resolve-arguments temp newdict)

         ;; Do the expansion
         (srecode-insert-fcn temp newdict)
         ))

   Lets look at the key functions involved above:

7.1 Interactive Completion:
===========================

 -- Function: srecode-read-template-name prompt
     Completing read for Semantic Recoder template names.  PROMPT is
     used to query for the name of the template desired.

7.2 Template Lookup
===================

Even if your program does not query the user for a template name, you
will need to locate a template.  First, you need to locate the table to
look the template up in.

 -- Function: srecode-table &optional mode
     Return the currently active Semantic Recoder table for this buffer.
     Optional argument MODE specifies the mode table to use.

 -- Function: srecode-template-get-table tab template-name &optional
          context application
     Find in the template in mode table TAB, the template with
     TEMPLATE-NAME.  Optional argument CONTEXT specifies a context a
     particular template would belong to.  Optional argument
     APPLICATION restricts searches to only template tables belonging
     to a specific application.  If APPLICATION is `nil', then only
     tables that do not belong to an application will be searched.

   For purposes of an SRecode application, it is important to decide
what to call yoru application, and use that with this method call.

7.3 Creating dictionaries
=========================

Several dictionary calls are made in this example, including:
`srecode-create-dictionary'

`srecode-dictionary-set-value'

`srecode-dictionary-show-section'

`srecode-dictionary-add-section-dictionary'

   These are documented more fully *note Dictionaries::.

   Also used is `srecode-resolve-arguments'.  To learn more about that,
see *note Argument Resolution::.

7.4 Template Insertion Commands
===============================

There are several ways to insert a template.  It is easiest to just
start with the main entry point.

 -- Function: srecode-insert-fcn template dictionary &optional stream
     Insert TEMPLATE using DICTIONARY into STREAM.  If STREAM is nil,
     then use the current buffer.

8 Template Naming Conventions
*****************************

For SRecode to work across langauges reliably, templates need to follow
a predictable pattern.  For every language of similar nature (OO,
functional, doc based) if they all provide the same base templates,
then an application can be written against the base templates, and it
will work in each of the supported language.

   Having consistent templates also makes it easy to use those templates
from a user perspective during basic interactive insertion via
`srecode-minor-mode'.

   NOTES ON THIS CHAPTER:

   These conventions are being worked on.  Check w/ CEDET-DEVEL mailing
list if you want to support a language, or write an application and
provide your opinions on this topic.  Any help is appreciated.

8.1 Context: File
=================

Each language should support the `file:empty' template.  This will
generally use the default copyright insertion mechanism.

8.2 Context: Declaration
========================

Functional languages should attempt to support the following:

`function'
     A standalone function.  Not a method, external method, or other.

`method'
     A method belonging to some class declaired outside the textual
     bounds of that class' declaration.

`variable'
     A global variable.

`type'
     A data type.  If the language supports several types of datatypes
     then do not use this, use more specific ones instead.

`class'
     For OO languages, use this instead of `type'.

`include'
     Include files.

   For any Semantic tag class in your language, you will likely want to
have a corresponding template.

   In order for the SRecode function `srecode-semantic-insert-tag' to
work, you can create templates similar to those mentioned above, except
with `-tag' appended to the end.  This lets a template like `function'
have user conveniences when referencing `function-tag', while also
allowing the tag inserter to do its job with a simpler template.

8.3 Context: Classdef
=====================

Inside a class definition.  These are to be inserted inside the textual
bounds of a class declaration.

`function'
     This would be a method of the class being inserted into.

`constructor'
`destructor'
     Like `function' but specific to alloc/delete of an object.

`variable'
     This would be a field of the class being inserted into.

8.4 Context: Code
=================

Inside a body of code, such as a function or method body.

   --no conventions yet.

8.5 Standard Dictionary Values
==============================

For these variables to be useful, standard names should be used.  These
values could be provided directly from a Semantic tag, or by an
application.

NAME
     The name of the declaration being created.

PARENT
     If the item belongs to some parent type, it would be the full name
     of that type, including namespaces.

TYPE
     A datatype name for a variable, or the return value of a function.

DOC
     If there is some documentation associated with the item, then DOC
     should contain the value.  (Optional)

ARGS
     The ARGS variable defines a section for 0 or more arguments to a
     function or method.  Each entry in ARGS will follow the rest of
     these naming conventions, such as for NAME and TYPE.

   For templates used by `srecode-semantic-insert-tag', there is also
the following useful dictionary values.

TAG
     A special insertion value TAG.  You can use semantic functions to
     turn the tag into a string.

HAVEDEFAULT
DEFAULT
     Default value for a variable.

9 Inserting Tag Lists
*********************

Since SRecode is the Semantic Recoder, the ultimate goal for SRecode is
to convert lists of tags, as produced by Semantic back into code.

   A single function provides the interface for programs to do this, but
it requires any particular language to have provided the correct
templates to make it work.

 -- Function: srecode-semantic-insert-tag tag &optional style-option
          point-insert-fcn &rest dict-entries
     Insert TAG into a buffer using srecode templates at point.

     Optional STYLE-OPTION is a list of minor configuration of styles,
     such as the symbol `'prototype' for prototype functions, or
     `'system' for system includes, and `'doxygen', for a doxygen style
     comment.

     Optional third argument POINT-INSERT-FCN is a hook that is run
     after TAG is inserted that allows an opportunity to fill in the
     body of some thing.  This hook function is called with one
     argument, the TAG being inserted.

     The rest of the arguments are DICT-ENTRIES.  DICT-ENTRIES is of
     the form ( NAME1 VALUE1 NAME2 VALUE2 ... NAMEn VALUEn).

     The exact template used is based on the current context.  The
     template used is found within the toplevel context as calculated
     by "srecode-calculate-context", such as `declaration', `classdecl',
     or `code'.

     For various conditions, this function looks for a template with
     the name CLASS-tag, where CLASS is the tag class.  If it cannot
     find that, it will look for that template in the
     `declaration'context (if the current context was not
     `declaration').

     If PROTOTYPE is specified, it will first look for templates with
     the name CLASS-tag-prototype, or CLASS-prototype as above.

     See "srecode-semantic-apply-tag-to-dict" for details on what is in
     the dictionary when the templates are called.

     This function returns to location in the buffer where the inserted
     tag ENDS, and will leave point inside the inserted text based on
     any occurrence of a point-inserter.  Templates such as "function"
     will leave point where code might be inserted.

10 Application Writing
**********************

The main goal of SRecode is to provide a strong platform for writing
code generating applications.

   Any templates that are application specific should make an
application declaration for each template file they use.  This prevents
those templates from being used outside of that application.

   For example, add this to a file:
     set application "getset"

   In your application Emacs Lisp code, you would then load those
templates.  A typical initialization would look like this:

       (srecode-load-tables-for-mode major-mode)
       (srecode-load-tables-for-mode major-mode 'getset)

   These two lines will load in the base templates for the major mode,
and then the application specific templates.

 -- Function: srecode-load-tables-for-mode mmode &optional appname
     Load all the template files for MMODE.  Templates are found in the
     SRecode Template Map.  See "srecode-get-maps" for more.  APPNAME
     is the name of an application.  In this case, all template files
     for that application will be loaded.

   todo: Add examples.  Most core stuff is already described above.

Appendix A GNU Free Documentation License
*****************************************

                     Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

     Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008, 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     `http://fsf.org/'

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You
     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
     way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
     and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from
     you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and
     not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of
     the same material does not give you any rights to use it.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy
     can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

 11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
