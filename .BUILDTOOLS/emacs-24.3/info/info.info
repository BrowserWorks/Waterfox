Info: An Introduction
*********************

The GNU Project distributes most of its on-line manuals in the "Info
format", which you read using an "Info reader".  You are probably using
an Info reader to read this now.

   There are two primary Info readers: `info', a stand-alone program
designed just to read Info files (*note What is Info?:
(info-stnd)Top.), and the `info' package in GNU Emacs, a
general-purpose editor.  At present, only the Emacs reader supports
using a mouse.

   If you are new to the Info reader and want to learn how to use it,
type the command `h' now.  It brings you to a programmed instruction
sequence.

   To read about advanced Info commands, type `n' twice.  This brings
you to `Advanced Info Commands', skipping over the `Getting Started'
chapter.

   This file describes how to use Info, the on-line, menu-driven GNU
documentation system.

1.1 Starting Info on a Small Screen
===================================

Since your terminal has a relatively small number of lines on its
screen, it is necessary to give you special advice at the beginning.

   If the entire text you are looking at fits on the screen, the text
`All' will be displayed at the bottom of the screen.  In the
stand-alone Info reader, it is displayed at the bottom right corner of
the screen; in Emacs, it is displayed on the modeline.  If you see the
text `Top' instead, it means that there is more text below that does
not fit.  To move forward through the text and see another screen full,
press <SPC>, the Space bar.  To move back up, press the key labeled
`Backspace' or `DEL' (on some keyboards, this key might be labeled
`Delete').

   Here are 40 lines of junk, so you can try <SPC> and <DEL> and see
what they do.  At the end are instructions of what you should do next.

   If you have managed to get here, go back to the beginning with `DEL'
(or <BACKSPACE>), and come back here again, then you understand the
about the `Space' and `Backspace' keys.  So now type an `n'--just one
character; don't type the quotes and don't type the Return key
afterward--to get to the normal start of the course.

1.2 How to use Info
===================

You are talking to the program Info, for reading documentation.

   There are two ways to use Info: from within Emacs or as a
stand-alone reader that you can invoke from a shell using the command
`info'.

   Right now you are looking at one "Node" of Information.  A node
contains text describing a specific topic at a specific level of
detail.  This node's topic is "how to use Info".  The mode line says
that this is node `Help' in the file `info'.

   The top line of a node is its "header".  This node's header (look at
it now) says that the `Next' node after this one is the node called
`Help-P'.  An advanced Info command lets you go to any node whose name
you know.  In the stand-alone Info reader program, the header line
shows the names of this node and the Info file as well.  In Emacs, the
header line is displayed with a special typeface, and remains at the
top of the window all the time even if you scroll through the node.

   Besides a `Next', a node can have a `Previous' link, or an `Up'
link, or both.  As you can see, this node has all of these links.

   Now it is time to move on to the `Next' node, named `Help-P'.

>> Type `n' to move there.  Type just one character;
   do not type the quotes and do not type a <RET> afterward.

`>>' in the margin means it is really time to try a command.

>> If you are in Emacs and have a mouse, and if you already practiced
   typing `n' to get to the next node, click now with the left
   mouse button on the `Next' link to do the same "the mouse way".


File: info.info,  Node: Help-P,  Next: Help-^L,  Prev: Help,  Up: Getting Started

1.3 Returning to the Previous node
==================================

This node is called `Help-P'.  The `Previous' node, as you see, is
`Help', which is the one you just came from using the `n' command.
Another `n' command now would take you to the next node, `Help-^L'.

>> But do not type `n' yet.  First, try the `p' command, or
   (in Emacs) click on the `Prev' link.  That takes you to
   the `Previous' node.  Then use `n' to return here.

   If you read this in Emacs, you will see an `Info' item in the menu
bar, close to its right edge.  Clicking the mouse on the `Info'
menu-bar item opens a menu of commands which include `Next' and
`Previous' (and also some others which you didn't yet learn about).

   This all probably seems insultingly simple so far, but _please
don't_ start skimming.  Things will get complicated soon enough!  Also,
please do not try a new command until you are told it is time to.  You
could make Info skip past an important warning that was coming up.

>> Now do an `n', or (in Emacs) click the middle mouse button on
   the `Next' link, to get to the node `Help-^L' and learn more.


File: info.info,  Node: Help-^L,  Next: Help-Inv,  Prev: Help-P,  Up: Getting Started

1.4 The Space, DEL, B and ^L commands
=====================================

This node's mode line tells you that you are now at node `Help-^L', and
the header line tells you that `p' would get you back to `Help-P'.  The
node's title is highlighted and may be underlined as well; it says what
the node is about.

   This is a big node and it does not all fit on your display screen.
You can tell that there is more that is not visible because you can see
the text `Top' rather than `All' near the bottom of the screen.

   The <SPC>, <BACKSPACE> (or <DEL>)(1) and `b' commands exist to allow
you to "move around" in a node that does not all fit on the screen at
once.  <SPC> moves forward, to show what was below the bottom of the
screen.  <DEL> or <BACKSPACE> moves backward, to show what was above
the top of the screen (there is not anything above the top until you
have typed some spaces).

>> Now try typing a <SPC> (afterward, type a <BACKSPACE> to
   return here).

   When you type the <SPC>, the two lines that were at the bottom of
the screen appear at the top, followed by more lines.  <DEL> or
<BACKSPACE> takes the two lines from the top and moves them to the
bottom, _usually_, but if there are not a full screen's worth of lines
above them they may not make it all the way to the bottom.

   If you are reading this in Emacs, note that the header line is
always visible, never scrolling off the display.  That way, you can
always see the `Next', `Prev', and `Up' links, and you can conveniently
go to one of these links at any time by clicking the middle mouse
button on the link.

   <SPC> and <DEL> not only move forward and backward through the
current node.  They also move between nodes.  <SPC> at the end of a
node moves to the next node; <DEL> (or <BACKSPACE>) at the beginning of
a node moves to the previous node.  In effect, these commands scroll
through all the nodes in an Info file as a single logical sequence.
You can read an entire manual top to bottom by just typing <SPC>, and
move backward through the entire manual from bottom to top by typing
<DEL> (or <BACKSPACE>).

   In this sequence, a node's subnodes appear following their parent.
If a node has a menu, <SPC> takes you into the subnodes listed in the
menu, one by one.  Once you reach the end of a node, and have seen all
of its subnodes, <SPC> takes you to the next node or to the parent's
next node.

   Many keyboards nowadays have two scroll keys labeled `PageUp' and
`PageDown' (or maybe `Prior' and `Next').  If your keyboard has these
keys, you can use them to move forward and backward through the text of
one node, like <SPC> and <BACKSPACE> (or <DEL>).  However, <PAGEUP> and
<PAGEDOWN> keys never scroll beyond the beginning or the end of the
current node.

   If your screen is ever garbaged, you can tell Info to display it
again by typing `C-l' (`Control-L'--that is, hold down <CTRL> and type
`L' or `l').

>> Type `C-l' now.

   To move back to the beginning of the node you are on, you can type
the <BACKSPACE> key (or <DEL>) many times.  You can also type `b' just
once.  `b' stands for "beginning."

>> Try that now.  (We have put in enough verbiage to push this past
   the first screenful, but screens are so big nowadays that perhaps it
   isn't enough.  You may need to shrink your Emacs or Info window.)
   Then come back, by typing <SPC> one or more times.

   You have just learned a considerable number of commands.  If you
want to use one but have trouble remembering which, you should type
`?', which displays a brief list of commands.  When you are finished
looking at the list, make it go away by typing <SPC> repeatedly.

>> Type a <?> now.  Press <SPC> to see consecutive screenfuls of
   the list until finished.  Then type <SPC> several times.  If
   you are using Emacs, the help will then go away automatically.

   (If you are using the stand-alone Info reader, type `C-x 0' to
return here, that is--press and hold <CTRL>, type an `x', then release
<CTRL> and `x', and press `0'; that's a zero, not the letter "o".)

   From now on, you will encounter large nodes without warning, and
will be expected to know how to use <SPC> and <BACKSPACE> to move
around in them without being told.  Since not all terminals have the
same size screen, it would be impossible to warn you anyway.

>> Now type `n', or click the middle mouse button on the `Next' link,
   to visit the next node.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The key which we call "Backspace or DEL" in this manual is
labeled differently on different keyboards.  Look for a key which is a
little ways above the <ENTER> or <RET> key and which you normally use
outside Emacs to erase the character before the cursor, i.e., the
character you typed last.  It might be labeled `Backspace' or `<-' or
`DEL', or sometimes `Delete'.

1.5 Invisible text in Emacs Info
================================

Before discussing menus, we need to make some remarks that are only
relevant to users reading Info using Emacs.  Users of the stand-alone
version can skip this node by typing `]' now.

   In Emacs, certain text that appears in the stand-alone version is
normally hidden, technically because it has the `invisibility'
property.  Invisible text is really a part of the text.  It becomes
visible (by default) after killing and yanking, it appears in printed
output, it gets saved to file just like any other text, and so on.
Thus it is useful to know it is there.

   You can make invisible text visible by using the command `M-x
visible-mode'.  Visible mode is a minor mode, so using the command a
second time will make the text invisible again.  Watch the effects of
the command on the "menu" below and the top line of this node.

   If you prefer to _always_ see the invisible text, you can set
`Info-hide-note-references' to `nil'.  Enabling Visible mode
permanently is not a real alternative, because Emacs Info also uses
(although less extensively) another text property that can change the
text being displayed, the `display' property.  Only the invisibility
property is affected by Visible mode.  When, in this tutorial, we refer
to the `Emacs' behavior, we mean the _default_ Emacs behavior.

   Now type `]', to learn about the `]' and `[' commands.

* Menu:

* ]:         Help-].               Node telling about ].
* stuff:     Help-].               Same node.
* Help-]::                         Yet again, same node.


File: info.info,  Node: Help-],  Up: Help-Inv

1.5.1 The `]' and `[' commands
------------------------------

If you type `n' now, you get an error message saying that this node has
no next node.  Similarly, if you type `p', the error message tells you
that there is no previous node.  (The exact message depends on the Info
reader you use.)  This is because `n' and `p' carry you to the next and
previous node _at the same level_.  The present node is contained in a
menu (see next) of the node you came from, and hence is considered to
be at a lower level.  It is the only node in the previous node's menu
(even though it was listed three times). Hence it has no next or
previous node that `n' or `p' could move to.

   If you systematically move through a manual by typing `n', you run
the risk of skipping many nodes.  You do not run this risk if you
systematically use `<SPC>', because, when you scroll to the bottom of a
node and type another `<SPC>', then this carries you to the following
node in the manual _regardless of level_.  If you immediately want to
go to that node, without having to scroll to the bottom of the screen
first, you can type `]'.

   Similarly, `<BACKSPACE>' carries you to the preceding node
regardless of level, after you scrolled to the beginning of the present
node.  If you want to go to the preceding node immediately, you can
type `['.

   For instance, typing this sequence will come back here in three
steps: `[ n ['.  To do the same backward, type `] p ]'.

   Now type `]' to go to the next node and learn about menus.


File: info.info,  Node: Help-M,  Next: Help-Xref,  Prev: Help-Inv,  Up: Getting Started

1.6 Menus and the `m' command
=============================

With only the `n' (next), `p' (previous), `<SPC>', `<BACKSPACE>', `]'
and `[' commands for moving between nodes, nodes are restricted to a
linear sequence.  Menus allow a branching structure.  A menu is a list
of other nodes you can move to.  It is actually just part of the text
of the node formatted specially so that Info can interpret it.  The
beginning of a menu is always identified by a line which starts with
`* Menu:'.  A node contains a menu if and only if it has a line in it
which starts that way.  The only menu you can use at any moment is the
one in the node you are in.  To use a menu in any other node, you must
move to that node first.

   After the start of the menu, each line that starts with a `*'
identifies one subtopic.  The line usually contains a brief name for
the subtopic (followed by a `:', normally hidden in Emacs), the name of
the node that talks about that subtopic (again, normally hidden in
Emacs), and optionally some further description of the subtopic.  Lines
in the menu that do not start with a `*' have no special meaning--they
are only for the human reader's benefit and do not define additional
subtopics.  Here is an example:

     * Foo:  Node about FOO.      This tells about FOO.

   The subtopic name is Foo, and the node describing it is `Node about
FOO'.  The rest of the line is just for the reader's Information.  [[
But this line is not a real menu item, simply because there is no line
above it which starts with `* Menu:'.  Also, in a real menu item, the
`*' would appear at the very start of the line.  This is why the
"normally hidden" text in Emacs, namely `: Node about FOO.', is
actually visible in this example, even when Visible mode is off.]]

   When you use a menu to go to another node (in a way that will be
described soon), what you specify is the subtopic name, the first thing
in the menu line.  Info uses it to find the menu line, extracts the
node name from it, and goes to that node.  The reason that there is
both a subtopic name and a node name is that the node name must be
meaningful to the computer and may therefore have to be ugly looking.
The subtopic name can be chosen just to be convenient for the user to
specify.  Often the node name is convenient for the user to specify and
so both it and the subtopic name are the same.  There is an
abbreviation for this:

     * Foo::   This tells about FOO.

This means that the subtopic name and node name are the same; they are
both `Foo'.  (The `::' is normally hidden in Emacs.)

>> Now use <SPC> to find the menu in this node, then come back to
   the front with a `b' and some <SPC>s.  As you see, a menu is
   actually visible in its node.  If you cannot find a menu in a node
   by looking at it, then the node does not have a menu and the
   `m' command is not available.

   If you keep typing <SPC> once the menu appears on the screen, it
will move to another node (the first one in the menu).  If that
happens, type <BACKSPACE> to come back.

   The command to go to one of the subnodes is `m'.  This is very
different from the commands you have used: it is a command that prompts
you for more input.

   The Info commands you know do not need additional input; when you
type one of them, Info processes it instantly and then is ready for
another command.  The `m' command is different: it needs to know the
"name of the subtopic".  Once you have typed `m', Info tries to read
the subtopic name.

   Now, in the stand-alone Info, look for the line containing many
dashes near the bottom of the screen.  (This is the stand-alone
equivalent for the mode line in Emacs.)  There is one more line beneath
that one, but usually it is blank.  (In Emacs, this is the echo area.)
When it is blank, Info is ready for a command, such as `n' or `b' or
<SPC> or `m'.  If that line contains text ending in a colon, it means
Info is reading more input for the last command.  You can't type an
Info command then, because Info is trying to read input, not commands.
You must either give the input and finish the command you started, or
type `Control-g' to cancel the command.  When you have done one of
those things, the input entry line becomes blank again.  Then you can
type Info commands again.

   The command to go to a subnode via a menu is `m'.  After you type
the `m', the line at the bottom of the screen says `Menu item: '.  You
must then type the name of the subtopic you want, and end it with a
<RET>.

   You can abbreviate the subtopic name.  If the abbreviation is not
unique, the first matching subtopic is chosen.  Some menus put the
shortest possible abbreviation for each subtopic name in capital
letters, so you can see how much you need to type.  It does not matter
whether you use upper case or lower case when you type the subtopic.
You should not put any spaces at the end, or inside of the item name,
except for one space where a space appears in the item in the menu.

   You can also use the "completion" feature to help enter the subtopic
name.  If you type the <TAB> key after entering part of a name, it will
fill in more of the name--as much as Info can deduce from the part you
have entered.

   If you move the cursor to one of the menu subtopic lines, then you do
not need to type the argument: you just type a <RET>, and it stands for
the subtopic of the line you are on.  You can also click the middle
mouse button directly on the subtopic line to go there.

   Here is a menu to give you a chance to practice.  This menu gives you
three ways of going to one place, Help-FOO:

* Menu:

* Foo:  Help-FOO.       A node you can visit for fun.
* Bar:  Help-FOO.       We have made two ways to get to the same place.
* Help-FOO::            And yet another!

   (Turn Visible mode on if you are using Emacs.)

>>  Now type just an `m' and see what happens:

   Now you are "inside" an `m' command.  Commands cannot be used now;
the next thing you will type must be the name of a subtopic.

   You can change your mind about doing the `m' by typing `Control-g'.

>> Try that now;  notice the bottom line clear.

>> Then type another `m'.

>> Now type `BAR', the item name.  Do not type <RET> yet.

   While you are typing the item name, you can use the <DEL> (or
<BACKSPACE>) key to cancel one character at a time if you make a
mistake.

>> Press <DEL> to cancel the `R'.  You could type another `R'
   to replace it.  But you do not have to, since `BA' is a valid
   abbreviation.

>> Now you are ready to go.  Type a <RET>.

   After visiting `Help-FOO', you should return here.

   Another way to move to the menu subtopic lines and between them is
to type <TAB>.  Each time you type a <TAB>, you move to the next
subtopic line.  To move to a previous subtopic line in the stand-alone
reader, type `M-<TAB>'--that is, press and hold the <META> key and then
press <TAB>.  (On some keyboards, the <META> key might be labeled
`Alt'.)  In Emacs Info, type `S-<TAB>' to move to a previous subtopic
line (press and hold the <Shift> key and then press <TAB>).

   Once you move cursor to a subtopic line, press <RET> to go to that
subtopic's node.

   If your terminal supports a mouse, you have yet another way of going
to a subtopic.  Move your mouse pointer to the subtopic line, somewhere
between the beginning `*' and the colon `:' which ends the subtopic's
brief name.  You will see the subtopic's name change its appearance
(usually, its background color will change), and the shape of the mouse
pointer will change if your platform supports that.  After a while, if
you leave the mouse on that spot, a small window will pop up, saying
"Mouse-2: go to that node," or the same message may appear at the
bottom of the screen.

   `Mouse-2' is the second button of your mouse counting from the
left--the middle button on a 3-button mouse.  (On a 2-button mouse, you
may have to press both buttons together to "press the middle button".)
The message tells you pressing `Mouse-2' with the current position of
the mouse pointer (on subtopic in the menu) will go to that subtopic.

   More generally, `Mouse-2' in an Info buffer finds the nearest link
to another node and goes there.  For example, near a cross reference it
acts like `f', in a menu it acts like `m', on the node's header line it
acts like `n', `p', or `u', etc.  At end of the node's text `Mouse-2'
moves to the next node, or up if there's no next node.

>> Type `n' to see more commands.


File: info.info,  Node: Help-FOO,  Up: Help-M

1.6.1 The `u' command
---------------------

Congratulations!  This is the node `Help-FOO'.  It has an `Up' pointer
`Help-M', the node you just came from via the `m' command.  This is the
usual convention--the nodes you reach from a menu have `Up' nodes that
lead back to the menu.  Menus move Down in the tree, and `Up' moves Up.
`Previous', on the other hand, is usually used to "stay on the same
level but go backwards".

   You can go back to the node `Help-M' by typing the command `u' for
"Up".  This puts you at the menu subtopic line pointing to the subnode
that the `u' command brought you from.  (Some Info readers may put you
at the _front_ of the node instead--to get back to where you were
reading, you have to type some <SPC>s.)

   Another way to go Up is to click `Mouse-2' on the `Up' pointer shown
in the header line (provided that you have a mouse).

>> Now type `u' to move back up to `Help-M'.

1.7 Following Cross-References
==============================

In Info documentation, you will see many "cross references".  Cross
references look like this: *Note Cross: Help-Cross.  That text is a
real, live cross reference, whose name is `Cross' and which points to
the node named `Help-Cross'.  (The node name is hidden in Emacs.  Do
`M-x visible-mode' to show or hide it.)

   You can follow a cross reference by moving the cursor to it and
press <RET>, just as in a menu.  In Emacs, you can also click `Mouse-1'
on a cross reference to follow it; you can see that the cross reference
is mouse-sensitive by moving the mouse pointer to the reference and
watching how the underlying text and the mouse pointer change in
response.

   Another way to follow a cross reference is to type `f' and then
specify the name of the cross reference (in this case, `Cross') as an
argument.  For this command, it does not matter where the cursor was.
If the cursor is on or near a cross reference, `f' suggests that
reference name in parentheses as the default; typing <RET> will follow
that reference.  However, if you type a different reference name, `f'
will follow the other reference which has that name.

>> Type `f', followed by `Cross', and then <RET>.

   As you enter the reference name, you can use the <DEL> (or
<BACKSPACE>) key to edit your input.  If you change your mind about
following any reference, you can use `Control-g' to cancel the command.
Completion is available in the `f' command; you can complete among all
the cross reference names in the current node by typing a <TAB>.

   To get a list of all the cross references in the current node, you
can type `?' after an `f'.  The `f' continues to await a cross
reference name even after displaying the list, so if you don't actually
want to follow a reference, you should type a `Control-g' to cancel the
`f'.

>> Type `f?' to get a list of the cross references in this node.  Then
   type a `Control-g' and see how the `f' gives up.

   The <TAB>, `M-<TAB>' and `S-<TAB>' keys, which move between menu
items in a menu, also move between cross references outside of menus.

   Sometimes a cross reference (or a node) can lead to another file (in
other words another "manual"), or, on occasion, even a file on a remote
machine (although Info files distributed with Emacs or the stand-alone
Info avoid using remote links).  Such a cross reference looks like
this: *Note Overview of Texinfo: (texinfo)Top.  (After following this
link, type `l' to get back to this node.)  Here the name `texinfo'
between parentheses refers to the file name.  This file name appears in
cross references and node names if it differs from the current file, so
you can always know that you are going to be switching to another
manual and which one.

   However, Emacs normally hides some other text in cross-references.
If you put your mouse over the cross reference, then the information
appearing in a separate box (tool tip) or in the echo area will show
the full cross-reference including the file name and the node name of
the cross reference.  If you have a mouse, just leave it over the cross
reference *Note Overview of Texinfo: (texinfo)Top, and watch what
happens.  If you always like to have that information visible without
having to move your mouse over the cross reference, use `M-x
visible-mode', or set `Info-hide-note-references' to a value other than
`t' (*note Emacs Info Variables::).

1.8 Some intermediate Info commands
===================================

The introductory course is almost over; please continue a little longer
to learn some intermediate-level commands.

   Most Info files have an index, which is actually a large node
containing little but a menu.  The menu has one menu item for each
topic listed in the index.  (As a special feature, menus for indices
may also include the line number within the node of the index entry.
This allows Info readers to go to the exact line of an entry, not just
the start of the containing node.)

   You can get to the index from the main menu of the file with the `m'
command and the name of the index node; then you can use the `m'
command again in the index node to go to the node that describes the
topic you want.

   There is also a short-cut Info command, `i', which does all of that
for you.  It searches the index for a given topic (a string) and goes
to the node which is listed in the index for that topic.  *Note Search
Index::, for a full explanation.

   If you have been moving around to different nodes and wish to
retrace your steps, the `l' command (`l' for "last") will do that, one
node-step at a time.  As you move from node to node, Info records the
nodes where you have been in a special history list.  The `l' command
revisits nodes in the history list; each successive `l' command moves
one step back through the history.

>> Try typing `p p n' and then three `l''s, pausing in between
to see what each `l' does.  You should wind up right back here.

   Note the difference between `l' and `p': `l' moves to where _you_
last were, whereas `p' always moves to the node which the header says
is the `Previous' node (from this node, the `Prev' link leads to
`Help-Xref').

   You can use the `r' command (`Info-history-forward' in Emacs) to
revisit nodes in the history list in the forward direction, so that `r'
will return you to the node you came from by typing `l'.

   The `L' command (`Info-history' in Emacs) creates a virtual node
that contains a list of all nodes you visited.  You can select a
previously visited node from this menu to revisit it.

   The `d' command (`Info-directory' in Emacs) gets you instantly to
the Directory node.  This node, which is the first one you saw when you
entered Info, has a menu which leads (directly or indirectly, through
other menus), to all the nodes that exist.  The Directory node lists
all the manuals and other Info documents that are, or could be,
installed on your system.

>> Try doing a `d', then do an `l' to return here (yes,
   _do_ return).

   The `t' command moves to the `Top' node of the manual.  This is
useful if you want to browse the manual's main menu, or select some
specific top-level menu item.  The Emacs command run by `t' is
`Info-top-node'.

>> Now type `n' to see the last node of the course.

   *Note Advanced::, for more advanced Info features.

1.9 Quitting Info
=================

To get out of Info, back to what you were doing before, type `q' for
"Quit".  This runs `Info-exit' in Emacs.

   This is the end of the basic course on using Info.  You have learned
how to move in an Info document, and how to follow menus and cross
references.  This makes you ready for reading manuals top to bottom, as
new users should do when they learn a new package.

   Another set of Info commands is useful when you need to find
something quickly in a manual--that is, when you need to use a manual
as a reference rather than as a tutorial.  We urge you to learn these
search commands as well.  If you want to do that now, follow this cross
reference to *note Advanced::.

   Yet another set of commands are meant for experienced users; you can
find them by looking in the Directory node for documentation on Info.
Finding them will be a good exercise in using Info in the usual manner.

>> Type `d' to go to the Info directory node; then type
   `mInfo' and Return, to get to the node about Info and
   see what other help is available.

2 Advanced Info Commands
************************

This chapter describes various advanced Info commands.  (If you are
using a stand-alone Info reader, there are additional commands specific
to it, which are documented in several chapters of *note GNU Info:
(info-stnd)Top.)

   One advanced command useful with most of the others described here
is `C-q', which "quotes" the next character so that it is entered
literally (*note Inserting Text: (emacs)Inserting Text.).  For example,
pressing `?' ordinarily brings up a list of completion possibilities.
If you want to (for example) search for an actual `?' character, the
simplest way is to insert it using `C-q ?'.  This works the same in
Emacs and stand-alone Info.

File: info.info,  Node: Search Text,  Next: Search Index,  Up: Advanced

2.1 `s' searches Info documents
===============================

The commands which move between and inside nodes allow you to read the
entire manual or its large portions.  But what if you need to find some
information in the manual as fast as you can, and you don't know or
don't remember in what node to look for it?  This need arises when you
use a manual as a "reference", or when it is impractical to read the
entire manual before you start using the programs it describes.

   Info has powerful searching facilities that let you find things
quickly.  You can search either the manual text or its indices.

   The `s' command allows you to search a whole Info file for a string.
It switches to the next node if and when that is necessary.  You type
`s' followed by the string to search for, terminated by <RET>.  To
search for the same string again, just `s' followed by <RET> will do.
The file's nodes are scanned in the order they are in the file, which
has no necessary relationship to the order that they may be in the tree
structure of menus and `next' pointers.  But normally the two orders
are not very different.  In any case, you can always look at the mode
line to find out what node you have reached, if the header is not
visible (this can happen, because `s' puts your cursor at the
occurrence of the string, not at the beginning of the node).

   Instead of using `s' in Emacs Info and in the stand-alone Info, you
can use an incremental search started with `C-s' or `C-r'.  It can
search through multiple Info nodes.  *Note Incremental Search:
(emacs)Incremental Search.  In Emacs, you can disable this behavior by
setting the variable `Info-isearch-search' to `nil' (*note Emacs Info
Variables::).


File: info.info,  Node: Search Index,  Next: Go to node,  Prev: Search Text,  Up: Advanced

2.2 `i' searches the indices for specific subjects
==================================================

Since most topics in the manual should be indexed, you should try the
index search first before the text search.  The `i' command prompts you
for a subject and then looks up that subject in the indices.  If it
finds an index entry with the subject you typed, it goes to the node to
which that index entry points.  You should browse through that node to
see whether the issue you are looking for is described there.  If it
isn't, type `,' one or more times to go through additional index
entries which match your subject.

   The `i' command and subsequent `,' commands find all index entries
which include the string you typed _as a substring_.  For each match,
Info shows in the echo area the full index entry it found.  Often, the
text of the full index entry already gives you enough information to
decide whether it is relevant to what you are looking for, so we
recommend that you read what Info shows in the echo area before looking
at the node it displays.

   Since `i' looks for a substring, you can search for subjects even if
you are not sure how they are spelled in the index.  For example,
suppose you want to find something that is pertinent to commands which
complete partial input (e.g., when you type <TAB>).  If you want to
catch index entries that refer to "complete," "completion," and
"completing," you could type `icomplet<RET>'.

   Info documents which describe programs should index the commands,
options, and key sequences that the program provides.  If you are
looking for a description of a command, an option, or a key, just type
their names when `i' prompts you for a topic.  For example, if you want
to read the description of what the `C-l' key does, type `iC-l<RET>'
literally.

   Emacs provides the command `Info-virtual-index', bound to the `I'
key.  This behaves like `i', but constructs a virtual info node
displaying the results of an index search, making it easier to select
the one you want.

   If you aren't sure which manual documents the topic you are looking
for, try the `M-x info-apropos' command in Emacs, or the `M-x
index-apropos' command in the stand-alone reader.  It prompts for a
string and then looks up that string in all the indices of all the Info
documents installed on your system.


File: info.info,  Node: Go to node,  Next: Choose menu subtopic,  Prev: Search Index,  Up: Advanced

2.3 `g' goes to a node by name
==============================

If you know a node's name, you can go there by typing `g', the name,
and <RET>.  Thus, `gTop<RET>' would go to the node called `Top' in this
file.  (This is equivalent to `t', see *note Help-Int::.)  `gGo to
node<RET>' would come back here.

   Unlike `m', `g' does not allow the use of abbreviations.  But it
does allow completion, so you can type <TAB> to complete a partial node
name.

   To go to a node in another file, you can include the file name in the
node name by putting it at the front, in parentheses.  Thus,
`g(dir)Top<RET>' would go to the Info Directory node, which is the node
`Top' in the Info file `dir'.  Likewise, `g(emacs)Top<RET>' goes to the
top node of the Emacs manual.

   The node name `*' specifies the whole file.  So you can look at all
of the current file by typing `g*<RET>' or all of any other file with
`g(FILENAME)*<RET>'.


File: info.info,  Node: Choose menu subtopic,  Next: Create Info buffer,  Prev: Go to node,  Up: Advanced

2.4 `1'-`9' choose a menu subtopic by its number
================================================

If you begrudge each character of type-in which your system requires,
you might like to use the commands `1', `2', `3', `4', ..., `9'.  They
are short for the `m' command together with a name of a menu subtopic.
`1' goes through the first item in the current node's menu; `2' goes
through the second item, etc.  In the stand-alone reader, `0' goes
through the last menu item; this is so you need not count how many
entries are there.

   If your display supports multiple fonts, colors or underlining, and
you are using Emacs's Info mode to read Info files, the third, sixth
and ninth menu items have a `*' that stands out, either in color or in
some other attribute, such as underline; this makes it easy to see at a
glance which number to use for an item.

   Some terminals don't support either multiple fonts, colors or
underlining.  If you need to actually count items, it is better to use
`m' instead, and specify the name, or use <TAB> to quickly move between
menu items.


File: info.info,  Node: Create Info buffer,  Next: Emacs Info Variables,  Prev: Choose menu subtopic,  Up: Advanced

2.5 `M-n' creates a new independent Info buffer in Emacs
========================================================

If you are reading Info in Emacs, you can select a new independent Info
buffer in a new Emacs window by typing `M-n'.  The new buffer starts
out as an exact copy of the old one, but you will be able to move
independently between nodes in the two buffers.  (In Info mode, `M-n'
runs the Emacs command `clone-buffer'.)

   In Emacs Info, you can also produce new Info buffers by giving a
numeric prefix argument to the `m' and `g' commands.  `C-u m' and `C-u
g' go to a new node in exactly the same way that `m' and `g' do, but
they do so in a new Info buffer which they select in another window.

   Another way to produce new Info buffers in Emacs is to use a numeric
prefix argument for the `C-h i' command (`info') which switches to the
Info buffer with that number.  Thus, `C-u 2 C-h i' switches to the
buffer `*info*<2>', creating it if necessary.

   If you have created many Info buffers in Emacs, you might find it
difficult to remember which buffer is showing which manual.  You can
use the command `M-x info-display-manual' to show an Info manual by
name, reusing an existing buffer if there is one.


File: info.info,  Node: Emacs Info Variables,  Prev: Create Info buffer,  Up: Advanced

2.6 Emacs Info-mode Variables
=============================

The following variables may modify the behavior of Info-mode in Emacs;
you may wish to set one or several of these variables interactively, or
in your init file.  *Note Examining and Setting Variables:
(emacs)Examining.  The stand-alone Info reader program has its own set
of variables, described in *note Manipulating Variables:
(info-stnd)Variables.

`Info-directory-list'
     The list of directories to search for Info files.  Each element is
     a string (directory name) or `nil' (try default directory).  If not
     initialized Info uses the environment variable `INFOPATH' to
     initialize it, or `Info-default-directory-list' if there is no
     `INFOPATH' variable in the environment.

     If you wish to customize the Info directory search list for both
     Emacs Info and stand-alone Info, it is best to set the `INFOPATH'
     environment variable, since that applies to both programs.

`Info-additional-directory-list'
     A list of additional directories to search for Info documentation
     files.  These directories are not searched for merging the `dir'
     file.

`Info-mode-hook'
     Hooks run when `Info-mode' is called.  By default, it contains the
     hook `turn-on-font-lock' which enables highlighting of Info files.
     You can change how the highlighting looks by customizing the faces
     `info-node', `info-xref', `info-xref-visited', `info-header-xref',
     `info-header-node', `info-menu-header', `info-menu-star', and
     `info-title-N' (where N is the level of the section, a number
     between 1 and 4).  To customize a face, type `M-x customize-face
     <RET> FACE <RET>', where FACE is one of the face names listed here.

`Info-fontify-maximum-menu-size'
     Maximum size of menu to fontify if `font-lock-mode' is non-`nil'.

`Info-fontify-visited-nodes'
     If non-`nil', menu items and cross-references pointing to visited
     nodes are displayed in the `info-xref-visited' face.

`Info-use-header-line'
     If non-`nil', Emacs puts in the Info buffer a header line showing
     the `Next', `Prev', and `Up' links.  A header line does not scroll
     with the rest of the buffer, making these links always visible.

`Info-hide-note-references'
     As explained in earlier nodes, the Emacs version of Info normally
     hides some text in menus and cross-references.  You can completely
     disable this feature, by setting this option to `nil'.  Setting it
     to a value that is neither `nil' nor `t' produces an intermediate
     behavior, hiding a limited amount of text, but showing all text
     that could potentially be useful.

`Info-scroll-prefer-subnodes'
     If set to a non-`nil' value, <SPC> and <BACKSPACE> (or <DEL>) keys
     in a menu visit subnodes of the current node before scrolling to
     its end or beginning, respectively.  For example, if the node's
     menu appears on the screen, the next <SPC> moves to a subnode
     indicated by the following menu item.  Setting this option to
     `nil' results in behavior similar to the stand-alone Info reader
     program, which visits the first subnode from the menu only when you
     hit the end of the current node.  The default is `nil'.

`Info-isearch-search'
     If non-`nil', isearch in Info searches through multiple nodes.

`Info-enable-active-nodes'
     When set to a non-`nil' value, allows Info to execute Lisp code
     associated with nodes.  The Lisp code is executed when the node is
     selected.  The Lisp code to be executed should follow the node
     delimiter (the `DEL' character) and an `execute: ' tag, like this:

          ^_execute: (message "This is an active node!")

3 Info for Experts
******************

This chapter explains how to write an Info file by hand.  However, in
most cases, writing a Texinfo file is better, since you can use it to
make a printed manual or produce other formats, such as HTML and
DocBook, as well as for generating Info files.

   The `makeinfo' command converts a Texinfo file into an Info file;
`texinfo-format-region' and `texinfo-format-buffer' are GNU Emacs
functions that do the same.

3.1 Adding a new node to Info
=============================

To add a new topic to the list in the Info directory, you must:

  1. Create some nodes, in some file, to document that topic.

  2. Put that topic in the menu in the directory.  *Note Menu: Menus.

   The new node can live in an existing documentation file, or in a new
one.  It must have a `^_' character before it (invisible to the user;
this node has one but you cannot see it), and it ends with either a
`^_', a `^L' ("formfeed"), or the end of file.(1)

   The `^_' starting a node must be followed by a newline or a `^L'
newline, after which comes the node's header line.  The header line
must give the node's name (by which Info finds it), and state the names
of the `Next', `Previous', and `Up' nodes (if there are any).  As you
can see, this node's `Up' node is the node `Expert Info'.  The `Next'
node is `Menus'.

   The keywords "Node", "Next", "Previous", and "Up" may appear in any
order, anywhere in the header line, but the recommended order is the
one in this sentence.  Each keyword must be followed by a colon, spaces
and tabs, and then the appropriate name.  The name may be terminated
with a tab, a comma, or a newline.  A space does not end it; node names
may contain spaces.  The case of letters in the names is insignificant.

   A node name has two forms.  A node in the current file is named by
what appears after the `Node: ' in that node's first line.  For
example, this node's name is `Add'.  A node in another file is named by
`(FILENAME)NODE-WITHIN-FILE', as in `(info)Add' for this node.  If the
file name starts with `./', then it is relative to the current
directory; otherwise, it is relative starting from the standard
directory for Info files of your site.  The name `(FILENAME)Top' can be
abbreviated to just `(FILENAME)'.  By convention, the name `Top' is used
for the "highest" node in any single file--the node whose `Up' points
out of the file.  The `Directory' node is `(dir)', it points to a file
`dir' which holds a large menu listing all the Info documents installed
on your site.  The `Top' node of a document file listed in the
`Directory' should have an `Up: (dir)' in it.

   The node name `*' is special: it refers to the entire file.  Thus,
`g*' shows you the whole current file.  The use of the node `*' is to
make it possible to make old-fashioned, unstructured files into nodes
of the tree.

   The `Node:' name, in which a node states its own name, must not
contain a file name, since when Info searches for a node, it does not
expect a file name to be there.  The `Next', `Previous' and `Up' names
may contain them.  In this node, since the `Up' node is in the same
file, it was not necessary to use one.

   Note that the nodes in this file have a file name in the header
line.  The file names are ignored by Info, but they serve as comments
to help identify the node for the user.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) If you put in a `^L' to end a new node, be sure that there is a
`^_' after it to start the next one, since `^L' cannot _start_ a node.
Also, a nicer way to make a node boundary be a page boundary as well is
to put a `^L' _right after_ the `^_'.


File: info.info,  Node: Menus,  Next: Cross-refs,  Prev: Add,  Up: Expert Info

3.2 How to Create Menus
=======================

Any node in the Info hierarchy may have a "menu"--a list of subnodes.
The `m' command searches the current node's menu for the topic which it
reads from the terminal.

   A menu begins with a line starting with `* Menu:'.  The rest of the
line is a comment.  After the starting line, every line that begins
with a `* ' lists a single topic.  The name of the topic--what the user
must type at the `m''s command prompt to select this topic--comes right
after the star and space, and is followed by a colon, spaces and tabs,
and the name of the node which discusses that topic.  The node name,
like node names following `Next', `Previous' and `Up', may be
terminated with a tab, comma, or newline; it may also be terminated
with a period.

   If the node name and topic name are the same, then rather than
giving the name twice, the abbreviation `* NAME::' may be used (and
should be used, whenever possible, as it reduces the visual clutter in
the menu).

   It is considerate to choose the topic names so that they differ from
each other very near the beginning--this allows the user to type short
abbreviations.  In a long menu, it is a good idea to capitalize the
beginning of each item name which is the minimum acceptable
abbreviation for it (a long menu is more than 5 or so entries).

   The nodes listed in a node's menu are called its "subnodes," and it
is their "superior".  They should each have an `Up:' pointing at the
superior.  It is often useful to arrange all or most of the subnodes in
a sequence of `Next' and `Previous' pointers so that someone who wants
to see them all need not keep revisiting the Menu.

   The Info Directory is simply the menu of the node `(dir)Top'--that
is, node `Top' in file `.../info/dir'.  You can put new entries in that
menu just like any other menu.  The Info Directory is _not_ the same as
the file directory called `info'.  It happens that many of Info's files
live in that file directory, but they do not have to; and files in that
directory are not automatically listed in the Info Directory node.

   Also, although the Info node graph is claimed to be a "hierarchy,"
in fact it can be _any_ directed graph.  Shared structures and pointer
cycles are perfectly possible, and can be used if they are appropriate
to the meaning to be expressed.  There is no need for all the nodes in
a file to form a connected structure.  In fact, this file has two
connected components.  You are in one of them, which is under the node
`Top'; the other contains the node `Help' which the `h' command goes
to.  In fact, since there is no garbage collector on the node graph,
nothing terrible happens if a substructure is not pointed to, but such
a substructure is rather useless since nobody can ever find out that it
exists.

3.3 Creating Cross References
=============================

A cross reference can be placed anywhere in the text, unlike a menu
item which must go at the front of a line.  A cross reference looks
like a menu item except that it has `*note' instead of `*'.  It
_cannot_ be terminated by a `)', because `)''s are so often part of
node names.  If you wish to enclose a cross reference in parentheses,
terminate it with a period first.  Here are two examples of cross
references pointers:

     *Note details: commands.  (See *note 3: Full Proof.)

_These are just examples._  The places they "lead to" do not really
exist!

* Menu:

* Help-Cross::                  Target of a cross-reference.

3.3.1 The node reached by the cross reference in Info
-----------------------------------------------------

This is the node reached by the cross reference named `Cross'.

   While this node is specifically intended to be reached by a cross
reference, most cross references lead to nodes that "belong" someplace
else far away in the structure of an Info document.  So you cannot
expect this node to have a `Next', `Previous' or `Up' links pointing
back to where you came from.  In general, the `l' (el) command is the
only way to get back there.

>> Type `l' to return to the node where the cross reference was.

3.4 Tags Tables for Info Files
==============================

You can speed up the access to nodes of a large Info file by giving it
a tags table.  Unlike the tags table for a program, the tags table for
an Info file lives inside the file itself and is used automatically
whenever Info reads in the file.

   To make a tags table, go to a node in the file using Emacs Info mode
and type `M-x Info-tagify'.  Then you must use `C-x C-s' to save the
file.  Info files produced by the `makeinfo' command that is part of
the Texinfo package always have tags tables to begin with.

   Once the Info file has a tags table, you must make certain it is up
to date.  If you edit an Info file directly (as opposed to editing its
Texinfo source), and, as a result of deletion of text, any node moves
back more than a thousand characters in the file from the position
recorded in the tags table, Info will no longer be able to find that
node.  To update the tags table, use the `Info-tagify' command again.

   An Info file tags table appears at the end of the file and looks like
this:

     ^_^L
     Tag Table:
     File: info, Node: Cross-refs^?21419
     File: info,  Node: Tags^?22145
     ^_
     End Tag Table

Note that it contains one line per node, and this line contains the
beginning of the node's header (ending just after the node name), a
`DEL' character, and the character position in the file of the
beginning of the node.

3.5 Checking an Info File
=========================

When creating an Info file, it is easy to forget the name of a node when
you are making a pointer to it from another node.  If you put in the
wrong name for a node, this is not detected until someone tries to go
through the pointer using Info.  Verification of the Info file is an
automatic process which checks all pointers to nodes and reports any
pointers which are invalid.  Every `Next', `Previous', and `Up' is
checked, as is every menu item and every cross reference.  In addition,
any `Next' which does not have a `Previous' pointing back is reported.
Only pointers within the file are checked, because checking pointers to
other files would be terribly slow.  But those are usually few.

   To check an Info file, do `M-x Info-validate' while looking at any
node of the file with Emacs Info mode.

Appendix A GNU Free Documentation License
*****************************************

                     Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

     Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008, 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     `http://fsf.org/'

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You
     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
     way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
     and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from
     you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and
     not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of
     the same material does not give you any rights to use it.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy
     can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

 11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:
