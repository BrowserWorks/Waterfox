EDE
***

EDE is the Emacs Development Environment: an Emacs extension that
simplifies building and debugging programs in Emacs.  It attempts to
emulate a typical IDE (Integrated Development Environment).  EDE can
manage or create your makefiles and other building environment duties,
allowing you to concentrate on writing code rather than support files.
It aims to make it much easier for new programmers to learn and adopt
GNU ways of doing things.

1 EDE Project Concepts
**********************

EDE is a generic interface for managing projects.  It specifies a
single set of menus and keybindings, while supporting multiple ways to
express a project via a build system.

   In the subsequent chapters, we will describe the different project
types (*note Creating a project::), as well as the commands to build
and debug projects (*note Building and Debugging::).

   In EDE, a project hierarchy matches a directory hierarchy.  The
project's topmost directory is called the "project root", and its
subdirectories are "subprojects".

   Each project can contain multiple "targets".  A target, at the
simplest level, is a named collection of files within a project.  A
target can specify two different types of information:

  1. A collection of files to be added to a distribution (e.g., a
     tarball that you intend to distribute to others).

  2. A collection of files that can be built into something else (e.g.,
     a program or compiled documentation).

   Lastly, EDE provides a way for other tools to easily learn file
associations.  For example, a program might need to restrict some sort
of search to files in a single target, or to discover the location of
documentation or interface files.  EDE can provide this information.

2 EDE Mode
**********

EDE is implemented as a minor mode, which augments other modes such as
C mode, and Texinfo mode.  You can enable EDE for all buffers by
running the command `global-ede-mode', or by putting this in your init
file:

     (global-ede-mode t)

   Activating EDE adds a menu named `Development' to the menu bar.
This menu provides several menu items for high-level EDE commands.
These menu items, and their corresponding keybindings, are independent
of the type of project you are actually working on.


File: ede.info,  Node: Quick Start,  Next: Creating a project,  Prev: EDE Mode,  Up: Top

3 Quick Start
*************

Once you have EDE enabled, you can create a project.  This chapter
provides an example C++ project that will create Automake files for
compilation.

3.1 Step 1: Create root directory
=================================

First, lets create a directory for our project.  For this example,
we'll start with something in `/tmp'.

     C-x C-f /tmp/myproject/README RET
     M-x make-directory RET RET

   Now put some plain text in your README file to start.

   Now, lets create the project:

     M-x ede-new RET Automake RET myproject RET

   Nothing visible happened, but if you use `dired' to look at the
directory, you should see this:

       /tmp/myproject:
       total used in directory 32 available 166643476
       drwxr-xr-x  2 zappo users  4096 2012-02-23 22:10 .
       drwxrwxrwt 73 root  root  20480 2012-02-23 22:10 ..
       -rw-r--r--  1 zappo users   195 2012-02-23 22:10 Project.ede
       -rw-r--r--  1 zappo users    10 2012-02-23 22:09 README

3.2 Step 2: Create Subdirectories and Files
===========================================

We'll make a more complex project, so use dired to create some more
directories using the `+' key, and typing in new directories:

     + include RET
     + src RET

   Now I'll short-cut in this tutorial.  Create the following files:

   `include/myproj.hh'
     /** myproj.hh ---
      */

     #ifndef myproj_hh
     #define myproj_hh 1

     #define IMPORTANT_MACRO 1

     int my_lib_function();

     #endif // myproj_hh

   `src/main.cpp'
     /** main.cpp ---
      */

     #include <iostream>
     #include "myproj.hh"

     int main() {

     }

     #ifdef IMPORTANT_MACRO
     int my_fcn() {

     }
     #endif

   `src/mylib.cpp'
     /** mylib.cpp ---
      *
      * Shared Library to build
      */

     int my_lib_function() {

     }

3.3 Step 3: Create subprojects
==============================

EDE needs subdirectories to also have projects in them.  You can now
create those projects.

   With `main.cpp' as your current buffer, type:

     M-x ede-new RET Automake RET src RET

   and in `myproj.hh' as your current buffer, type:

     M-x ede-new RET Automake RET include RET

   These steps effectively only create the Project.ede file in which you
will start adding targets.

3.4 Step 4: Create targets
==========================

In order to build a program, you must have targets in your EDE
Projects.  You can create targets either from a buffer, or from a
`dired' directory buffer.

   Note: If for some reason a directory list buffer, or file does not
have the `Project' menu item, or if EDE keybindings don't work, just
use `M-x revert-buffer RET' to force a refresh.  Sometimes creating a
new project doesn't restart buffers correctly.

   Lets start with the header file.  In `include/myproj.hh', you could
use the menu, but we will now start using the EDE command prefix which
is `C-c .'.

     C-c . t includes RET miscellaneous RET y

   This creates a misc target for holding your includes, and then adds
myproj.hh to the target.  Automake (the tool) has better ways to do
this, but for this project, it is sufficient.

   Next, visit the `src' directory using dired.  There should be a
`Project' menu.   You can create a new target with

     . t myprogram RET program RET

   Note that `. t' is a command for creating a target.  This command is
also in the menu.  This will create a target that will build a program.
If you want, visit `Project.ede' to see the structure built so far.

   Next, place the cursor on `main.cpp', and use `. a' to add that file
to your target.

     . a myprogram RET

   Note that these prompts often have completion, so you can just press
`TAB' to complete the name `myprogram'.

   If you had many files to add to the same target, you could mark them
all in your dired buffer, and add them all at the same time.

   Next, do the same for the library by placing the cursor on
`mylib.cpp'.

     . t mylib RET sharedobject RET
     . a mylib RET

3.5 Step 5: Compile, and fail
=============================

Next, we'll try to compile the project, but we aren't done yet, so it
won't work right away.

   Visit `/tmp/myproject/Project.ede'.  We're starting here because we
don't have any program files in this directory yet.  Now we can use the
compile command:

     C-c . C

   Because this is the very first time, it will create a bunch of files
for you that are required by Automake.  It will then use automake to
build the support infrastructure it needs.  This step is skipped if you
choose just a `Makefile' build system.

   After the Automake init, it runs compile.  You will immediately
discover the error in main.cpp can't find `myproj.hh'.  We need to go
fix this.

3.6 Step 6: Customizing your project
====================================

To fix the failed compile, we need to add `/tmp/myproject/include' to
the include path.

   Visit `main.cpp'.

     M-x customize-project RET

   Select the `[Settings]' subgroup of options.  Under `Variable :'
click `[INS]'.  At this point, you need to be somewhat savvy with
Automake.  Add a variable named `CPPFLAGS', and set the value to
`../include'.

   You should see something like this:

     Variables :
     [INS] [DEL] Cons-cell:
                 Name: AM_CPPFLAGS
                 Value: -I../include
     [INS]
     Variables to set in this Makefile.

   Click `[Apply]'.  Feel free to visit `Project.ede' to see how it
changed the config file.

   Compile the whole project again with `C-c . C' from `main.cpp'.  It
should now compile.

3.7 Step 7: Shared library dependency
=====================================

Note: Supporting shared libraries for Automake in this way is easy, but
doing so from a project of type Makefile is a bit tricky.  If you are
creating shared libraries too, stick to Automake projects.

   Next, lets add a dependency from `main.cpp' on our shared library.
To do that, update main like this:

     int main() {

       my_lib_function();

     }

   Now compile with:

     C-c . c

   where the lower case `c' compiles just that target.  You should see
an error.

   This time, we need to add a dependency from `main.cpp' on our shared
library.  To do that, we need to customize our target instead of the
project.  This is because variables such as the include path are
treated globally, whereas dependencies for a target are target specific.

     M-x customize-target RET

   On the first page, you will see an Ldlibs-local section.  Add mylib
to it by first clicking `[INS]', and they adding the library.  It
should look like this:

     Ldlibs-Local :
     [INS] [DEL] Local Library: libmylib.la
     [INS]
     Libraries that are part of this project. [Hide Rest]
     The full path to these libraries should be specified, such as:
     ../lib/libMylib.la  or ../ar/myArchive.a

   You will also see other variables for library related flags and
system libraries if you need them.  Click `[Accept]', and from
`main.cpp', again compile the whole project to force all dependent
elements to compile:

     C-c . C

3.8 Step 8: Run your program
============================

You can run your program directly from EDE.

     C-c . R RET RET

   If your program takes command line arguments, you can type them in
when it offers the command line you want to use to run your program.

4 Creating a project
********************

To create a new project, first visit a file that you want to include in
that project.  If you have a hierarchy of directories, first visit a
file in the topmost directory.  From this buffer, type `M-x ede-new',
or click on the `Create Project' item in the `Development' menu.

   The `ede-new' command prompts for the type of project you would like
to create.  Each project type has its own benefits or language specific
enhancements.  Not all projects that EDE supports also allow creating a
new project.  Projects such as `emacs' or `linux' are designed to
recognize existing projects only.  Project types such as `Make' and
`Automake' do support creating new project types with `ede-new'.

   * For the `Make' project type, EDE creates a "project file", called
     `Project.ede', in each project directory.  Information about the
     project is stored in this file.  This project autogenerates a
     `Makefile'.

   * For the `Automake' project type, EDE creates a `Project.ede'
     project file similar to a `Make' project.  Unlike a `Make'
     project, this project autogenerates a `Makefile.am' file.  EDE
     handles the Automake bootstrapping routines, which import and
     maintain a `configure.am' script and other required files.

   A subproject is merely a project in a subdirectory of another
project.  You can create a subproject by using the `ede-new' command (or
the `Create Project' menu item), while visiting a buffer in a
subdirectory of the project root.  This new project is automatically
added to the parent project, and will be automatically loaded when EDE
reads the parent project.

   When using a project command that involves a makefile, EDE uses the
top-most project's makefile as a starting place for the build.  How the
toplevel project handles subprojects in the build process is dependent
on that project's type.

5 Modifying your project
************************

In this chapter, we describe the generic features for manipulating
projects, including the targets and files within them.  Subsequent
chapters, which describe specific project types, will provide more
detailed information about exactly what these features do.

* Menu:

* Add/Remove target::
* Add/Remove files::
* Customize Features::
* Project Local Variables::
* EDE Project Features::


File: ede.info,  Node: Add/Remove target,  Next: Add/Remove files,  Prev: Modifying your project,  Up: Modifying your project

5.1 Add/Remove target
=====================

To create a new target, type `C-c . t' (`ede-new-target') or use the
`Add Target' menu item in the `Project Options' submenu.  This prompts
for a target name, and adds the current buffer to that target.

   The `ede-new-target' command also prompts for a "target type".  Each
target type has its own build process and class of files that it will
accept.

   To remove a target from the project, type `M-x ede-delete-target',
or use the `Remove Target' menu item in the `Project Options' submenu.


File: ede.info,  Node: Add/Remove files,  Next: Customize Features,  Prev: Add/Remove target,  Up: Modifying your project

5.2 Add/Remove files
====================

To add the current file to an existing target, type `C-c . a'
(`ede-add-file'), or use the `Add File' menu item in the `Target
Options' submenu.

   You can add a file to more than one target; this is OK.

   To remove the current file from a target, type `C-c . d'
(`ede-remove-file'), or use the `Remove File' menu item in the `Target
Options' submenu.  If the file belongs to multiple targets, this
command prompts for each target it could be removed from.

   While working in a project, if you visit a file that is not part of
an existing target, EDE automatically prompts for a target.  If you do
not wish to add the file to any target, you can choose `none'.  You can
customize this behavior with the variable `ede-auto-add-method'.


File: ede.info,  Node: Customize Features,  Next: Project Local Variables,  Prev: Add/Remove files,  Up: Modifying your project

5.3 Customize Features
======================

A project, and its targets, are objects using the `EIEIO' object
system.  *Note Top: (eieio)Top.  These objects have data fields
containing important information related to your work.

   If the high-level functions aren't enough, you can tweak all
user-customizable fields at any time by running the command
`customize-project' or `customize-target'.  This loads the current
project or target into a customization buffer, where you can tweak
individual slots.  This is usually necessary for complex projects.

   Some project modes do not have a project file, but directly read a
Makefile or other existing file.  Instead of directly editing the
object, you can edit the file by typing `C-c . e'
(`ede-edit-file-target').  You should "rescan" the project afterwards
(*note Miscellaneous commands::).


File: ede.info,  Node: Project Local Variables,  Next: EDE Project Features,  Prev: Customize Features,  Up: Modifying your project

5.4 Project Local Variables
===========================

EDE projects can store and manager project local variables.  The
variables are stored in the project, and will be restored when a
project reloads.

   Projects which are not stored on disk WILL NOT restore your project
local variables later.

   You can use *note Customize Features:: to of the project to edit the
project local variables.  They are under the 'Settings' group as
"Project Local Variables".

   You can also use `M-x ede-set' to set a new variable local in the
mini buffer.

   In multi-level projects such as Automake and Make generating
projects, project local variables are installed from both the TOP most
project, and the local directory's project.  In that way, you can have
some variables across your whole project, and some specific to a
subdirectory.

   You can use project local variables to set any Emacs variable so that
buffers belonging to different projects can have different settings.

   NOTE: When you use project-local variables with *note ede-cpp-root::,
the format is an association list.  For example:

     (ede-cpp-root-project "SOMENAME"
                            :file "/dir/to/some/file"
                            :local-variables
                            '((grep-command . "grep -nHi -e ")
                              (compile-command . "make -f MyCustomMakefile all")))

   The same is true when you use project-local variables with *note
ede-java-root::.  For example:

     (ede-java-root-project "SOMENAME"
                            :file "/dir/to/some/file"
                            :local-variables
                            '((grep-command . "grep -nHi -e ")
                              (compile-command . "ant")))


File: ede.info,  Node: EDE Project Features,  Prev: Project Local Variables,  Up: Modifying your project

5.5 EDE Project Features
========================

This section details user facing features of an EDE `Make' style
project.  An `Automake' project has similar options (but a direct
Automake project does not).

   To modify any of the specific features mentioned here, you need to
customize the project or target with `customize-project' or
`customize-target'.

   When you are customizing, you are directly manipulating slot values
in EIEIO objects.  *Note Extending EDE::, if you are interested in
additional details.

* Menu:

* Changing Compilers and Flags::
* Configurations::


File: ede.info,  Node: Changing Compilers and Flags,  Next: Configurations,  Prev: EDE Project Features,  Up: EDE Project Features

5.5.1 Changing Compilers and Flags
----------------------------------

Targets that build stuff need compilers.  To change compilers, you need
to customize the desired target.

   In the `[Make]' section, you can choose a new compiler or linker
from the list.  If a linker you need is not available, you will need to
create a new one.  *Note Compiler and Linker objects::.

   If an existing compiler or linker is close, but you need to modify
some flag set such as adding an include path you will need to add a
configuration variable.

   To start, you should create the basic setup, and construct a makefile
with `ede-proj-regenerate'.  Look in the `Makefile' to see what
commands are inserted.  Once you have determined the variable you need
to modify, you can add a configuration for it.  *Note Configurations::.


File: ede.info,  Node: Configurations,  Prev: Changing Compilers and Flags,  Up: EDE Project Features

5.5.2 Configurations
--------------------

Configurations specify different ways to build a project.  For example,
you may configure a project to be in "debug" mode, or perhaps in
"release" mode.

   The project, and each target type all have a slot named
`configuration-variables'.  To add new variables to a configuration
find this slot in the custom buffer, and insert a new configuration.
Name it either "debug" or "release", then insert some number of
name/value pairs to it.

   You can have any number of valid configurations too.  To add a new
configuration, customize your project.  Work in the `[Settings]' block
for "configurations".  Add a new named configuration here.

   To switch between different active configurations, modify the
"configuration default" slot.


File: ede.info,  Node: Building and Debugging,  Next: Miscellaneous commands,  Prev: Modifying your project,  Up: Top

6 Building and Debugging
************************

EDE provides the following "project-aware" compilation and debugging
commands:

`C-c . c'
     Compile the current target (`ede-compile-target').

`C-c . C'
     Compile the entire project (`ede-compile-project').

`c-c . D'
     Debug the current target (`ede-debug-target').

`M-x ede-make-dist'
     Build a distribution file for your project.

   These commands are also available from the `Development' menu.


File: ede.info,  Node: Miscellaneous commands,  Next: Extending EDE,  Prev: Building and Debugging,  Up: Top

7 Miscellaneous commands
************************

If you opt to go in and edit EDE project files directly--for instance,
by using `C-c . e' (*note Customize Features::)--you must then "rescan"
the project files to update the internal data structures.  To rescan
the current project, type `C-c . g' (`ede-rescan-toplevel').

   EDE can help you find files in your project, via the command `C-c .
f' (`ede-find-file').  This prompts for a file name; you need not
specify the directory.  EDE then tries to visit a file with that name
somewhere in your project.

   EDE can use external tools to help with file finding.  To do this,
customize `ede-locate-setup-options'.

 -- Variable: ede-locate-setup-options
     List of locate objects to try out by default.  Listed in order of
     preference.  If the first item cannot be used in a particular
     project, then the next one is tried.  It is always assumed that
     "ede-locate-base" is at end of the list.

   EDE also provides a project display mode for the speedbar (*note
Speedbar: (emacs)Speedbar.).  This allows you to view your source files
as they are structured in your project: as a hierarchical tree, grouped
according to target.

   To activate the speedbar in this mode, type `C-c . s'
(`ede-speedbar').

File: ede.info,  Node: Make and Automake projects,  Next: Automake direct projects,  Up: Miscellaneous commands

7.1 Make and Automake projects
==============================

A project of `ede-project' type creates a file called `Project.ede' in
every project directory.  This is used to track your configuration
information.  If you configure this project to be in `Makefile' mode,
then this project will autogenerate a `Makefile'.  If you configure it
in `Automake' mode a `Makefile.am' file will be created.  The automake
bootstrapping routines will also import and maintain a configure.am
script and a host of other files required by Automake.


File: ede.info,  Node: Automake direct projects,  Next: Android projects,  Prev: Make and Automake projects,  Up: Miscellaneous commands

7.2 Automake direct projects
============================

The project type that reads `Makefile.am' directly is derived from the
sources of the original `project-am.el' mode that was distributed
independently.  This mode eventually became EDE.  The `project-am'
project will read existing automake files, but will not generate them
automatically, or create new ones.  As such, it is useful as a browsing
tool, or as maintenance in managing file lists.


File: ede.info,  Node: Android projects,  Next: Arduino projects,  Prev: Automake direct projects,  Up: Miscellaneous commands

7.3 Android projects
====================

An Android project of type `ede-android-project' will detect and
support development of Android apps.  Android projects use an
`AndroidManifest.xml' file.  Always load your Manifest first in a
running Emacs to make sure the project is identified correctly.

   Android projects can be created with `ede-new' but depend on a
correctly configured Android SDK via CEDET support.

 -- Function: cedet-android-sdk-root
     The root to the android SDK.

   Android projects support different configurations including compile,
and install, which will upload a program to your Android device.  It
also supports several debugging tools via `android.el'.


File: ede.info,  Node: Arduino projects,  Next: Simple projects,  Prev: Android projects,  Up: Miscellaneous commands

7.4 Arduino projects
====================

An arduino project of type `ede-arduino-project' will read your
`~/.arduino/preferences.txt' file, and identify your sketches.  You
will still need the Arduino IDE to set up your preferences and locate
your arduino.  After quitting the IDE, Emacs will be able to find your
sketches, compile them, and upload them to your arduino.

   If you have the `arduino' command on your path, EDE will be able to
find your SDK and compile your programs.

7.5 Simple Projects
===================

There is a wide array of simple projects.  In this case a simple
project is one that detects, or is directed to identify a directory as
belonging to a project, but doesn't provide many features of a typical
EDE project.  Having the project however allows tools such as Semantic
to find sources and perform project level completions.

* Menu:

* ede-cpp-root::                This project marks the root of a C/C++ code project.
* ede-java-root::               This project marks the root of a Java project.
* ede-emacs::                   A project for working with Emacs.
* ede-linux::                   A project for working with Linux kernels.
* ede-generic-project::         A project type for wrapping build systems with EDE.

File: ede.info,  Node: ede-cpp-root,  Next: ede-java-root,  Prev: Simple projects,  Up: Simple projects

7.5.1 ede-cpp-root
------------------

The `ede-cpp-root' project type allows you to create a single object
with no save-file in your `.emacs' file.  It allows EDE to provide the
Semantic package with the ability to find header files quickly.

   The `ede-cpp-root' class knows a few things about C++ projects, such
as the prevalence of "include" directories, and typical file-layout
stuff.  If this isn't sufficient, you can subclass
`ede-cpp-root-project' and add your own tweaks in just a few lines.
See the end of this file for an example.

   In the most basic case, add this to your `.emacs' file, modifying
appropriate bits as needed.

     (ede-cpp-root-project "SOMENAME" :file "/dir/to/some/file")

   Replace SOMENAME with whatever name you want, and the filename to an
actual file at the root of your project.  It might be a Makefile, a
README file.  Whatever.  It doesn't matter.  It's just a key to hang
the rest of EDE off of.

   The most likely reason to create this project, is to speed up
searching for includes files, or to simplify bootstrapping Semantic's
ability to find files without much user interaction.  In conjunction
with Semantic completion, having a short include path is key.  You can
override the default include path and system include path like this:

     (ede-cpp-root-project "NAME" :file "FILENAME"
         :include-path '( "/include" "../include" "/c/include" )
         :system-include-path '( "/usr/include/c++/3.2.2/" )
         :spp-table '( ("MOOSE" . "")
                       ("CONST" . "const") ) )

   In this case each item in the include path list is searched.  If the
directory starts with "/", then that expands to the project root
directory.  If a directory does not start with "/", then it is relative
to the default-directory of the current buffer when the file name is
expanded.

   The include path only affects C/C++ header files.  Use the slot
`:header-match-regexp' to change it.

   The `:system-include-path' allows you to specify full directory
names to include directories where system header files can be found.
These will be applied to files in this project only.

   The `:spp-table' provides a list of project specific #define style
macros that are unique to this project, passed in to the compiler on
the command line, or are in special headers.  See the
`semantic-lex-c-preprocessor-symbol-map' for more on how to format this
entry.

   If there is a single file in your project, you can instead set the
`:spp-files' to a list of file names relative to the root of your
project.  Specifying this is like setting the variable
`semantic-lex-c-preprocessor-symbol-file' in semantic.

   If you want to override the file-finding tool with your own function
you can do this:

     (ede-cpp-root-project "NAME" :file "FILENAME" :locate-fcn 'MYFCN)

   Where MYFCN is a symbol for a function.  The locate function can be
used in place of `ede-expand-filename' so you can quickly customize
your custom target to use specialized local routines instead of the
default EDE routines.  The function symbol must take two arguments:

NAME
     The name of the file to find.

DIR
     The directory root for this cpp-root project.

   When creating a project with `ede-cpp-root', you can get additional
configurations via *note Project Local Variables::.  Be aware that the
format for project local variables is an association list.  You cannot
use `M-x ede-set' and have your project local variables persist between
sessions.

   If the cpp-root project style is right for you, but you want a
dynamic loader, instead of hard-coding path name values in your
`.emacs', you can do that too, but you will need to write some lisp
code.

   To do that, you need to add an entry to the
`ede-project-class-files' list, and also provide two functions to teach
EDE how to load your project pattern

   It would look like this:

     (defun MY-FILE-FOR-DIR (&optional dir)
       "Return a full file name to the project file stored in DIR."
       <write your code here, or return nil>
       )

     (defun MY-ROOT-FCN ()
       "Return the root fcn for `default-directory'"
       ;; You might be able to use `ede-cpp-root-project-root'
       ;; and not write this at all.
       )

     (defun MY-LOAD (dir)
       "Load a project of type `cpp-root' for the directory DIR.
     Return nil if there isn't one."
       ;; Use your preferred construction method here.
       (ede-cpp-root-project "NAME" :file (expand-file-name "FILE" dir)
                                    :locate-fcn 'MYFCN)
       )

     (add-to-list 'ede-project-class-files
                  (ede-project-autoload "cpp-root"
                   :name "CPP ROOT"
                   :file 'ede-cpp-root
                   :proj-file 'MY-FILE-FOR-DIR
                   :proj-root 'MY-ROOT-FCN
                   :load-type 'MY-LOAD
                   :class-sym 'ede-cpp-root)
                  t)

   This example only creates an auto-loader, and does not create a new
kind of project.

   *Note ede-cpp-root-project::, for details about the class that
defines the `ede-cpp-root' project type.


File: ede.info,  Node: ede-java-root,  Next: ede-emacs,  Prev: ede-cpp-root,  Up: Simple projects

7.5.2 ede-java-root
-------------------

Much like the project type *note ede-cpp-root::, the java variant is
can be setup in your `.emacs' file and just marks a directory as the
root of a java source tree.

   The `ede-java-root' project class knows a few things about Java
projects.  In particular, you can use it to control your classpath at
both the system level, and for your project.  If it is insufficient,
you can subclass `ede-java-root-project' and add your own tweaks in
just a few lines.  See *note ede-cpp-root:: for an example using the
C++ variant.

   In the most basic case, add this to your `.emacs' file, modifying
appropriate bits as needed.

     (ede-java-root-project "SOMENAME" :file "/dir/to/some/file" :srcroot '("src"))

   Replace SOMENAME with whatever name you want, and the filename to an
actual file at the root of your project.  It might be a Makefile, a
README file.  Whatever.  It doesn't matter.  It's just a key to hang
the rest of EDE off of.

   Replace the value of :srcroot with a list of directories under the
project root which contains Java sources.  For example, if you have:

     ~/myprojects/P1/
     ~/myprojects/P1/src/
     ~/myprojects/P1/src/com/ericsoft/MyCode.java
     ~/myprojects/P1/doc/

   Then `src' represents the directory under which all your Java code
is.  It is important that `src' is one step above the directory that is
the base of your package name, such as `com/ericsoft' in the example
above so that new files can be discovered via fully qualified name.
You can have multiple such directories in one project, and each will be
accessible.

   You can specify your classpath like this:

     (ede-java-root-project "NAME" :file "FILENAME"
         :srcroot '("src")
         :classpath '("/absolute/path.jar")
         :localclasspath '( "/relative/path.jar" ))

   In this example, `:classpath' specifies absolute paths somewhere on
your system, and the explicit jar or source root directories Semantic
will search when performing completions.

   The `:localclasspath' is like `:classpath', but it will contain path
names relative to the root of your project.

   If you want to override the file-finding tool with your own function
you can do this:

     (ede-java-root-project "NAME" :file "FILENAME" :locate-fcn 'MYFCN)

   Where MYFCN is a symbol for a function.  The locate function can be
used in place of `ede-expand-filename' so you can quickly customize
your custom target to use specialized local routines instead of the
default EDE routines.  The function symbol must take two arguments:

NAME
     The name of the file to find.

DIR
     The directory root for this java-root project.

   If you would like to create your Java projects dynamically, instead
of putting them all in your `.emacs', you can do that too.  See *note
ede-cpp-root:: for details that can be applied to this project type.

File: ede.info,  Node: ede-generic-project,  Next: Custom Locate,  Prev: ede-linux,  Up: Simple projects

7.5.5 ede-generic-project
-------------------------

The `ede-generic-project' is a project system that makes it easy to
wrap up different kinds of build systems as an EDE project.  Projects
such as *note ede-emacs:: require coding skills to create.  Generic
projects also require writing Emacs Lisp code, but the requirements are
minimal.  You can then use `customize-project' to configure build
commands, includes, and other options for that project.  The
configuration is saved in `EDEConfig.el'.

   Generic projects are disabled by default because they have the
potential to interfere with other projects.  To use the generic project
system to start detecting projects, you need to enable it.

 -- Command: ede-enable-generic-projects
     Enable generic project loaders.

     This enables generic loaders for projects that are detected using
     either a `Makefile', `SConstruct', or `CMakeLists'.

     You do not need to use this command if you create your own generic
     project type.

   If you want to create your own generic project loader, you need to
define your own project and target classes, and create an autoloader.
The example for Makefiles looks like this:

     ;;; MAKEFILE

     (defclass ede-generic-makefile-project (ede-generic-project)
       ((buildfile :initform "Makefile")
        )
       "Generic Project for makefiles.")

     (defmethod ede-generic-setup-configuration ((proj ede-generic-makefile-project) config)
       "Setup a configuration for Make."
       (oset config build-command "make -k")
       (oset config debug-command "gdb ")
       )

     (ede-generic-new-autoloader "generic-makefile" "Make"
     			    "Makefile" 'ede-generic-makefile-project)

   This example project will detect any directory with the file
`Makefile' in it as belonging to this project type.  Customization of
the project will allow you to make build and debug commands more
precise.


File: ede.info,  Node: Custom Locate,  Prev: ede-generic-project,  Up: Simple projects

7.5.6 Custom Locate
-------------------

The various simple project styles all have one major drawback, which is
that the files in the project are not completely known to EDE.  When
the EDE API is used to try and file files by some reference name in the
project, then that could fail.

   EDE can therefore use some external locate commands, such as the unix
"locate" command, or "GNU Global".

   Configuration of the tool you want to use such as `locate', or
`global' will need to be done without the aid of EDE.  Once configured,
however, EDE can use it.

   To enable one of these tools, set the variable
`ede-locate-setup-options' with the names of different locate objects.
*note Miscellaneous commands::.

   Configure this in your `.emacs' before loading in CEDET or EDE.  If
you want to add support for GNU Global, your configuration would look
like this:

     (setq ede-locate-setup-options '(ede-locate-global ede-locate-base))

   That way, when a search needs to be done, it will first try using
GLOBAL.  If global is not available for that directory, then it will
revert to the base locate object.  The base object always fails to find
a file.

   You can add your own locate tool but subclassing from
`ede-locate-base'.  The subclass should also implement two methods.
See the code in `ede-locate.el' for GNU Global as a simple example.

   @TODO - Add ID Utils and CScope examples

   More on idutils and cscope is in the CEDET manual, and they each have
their own section.

8 Extending EDE
***************

This chapter is intended for users who want to write new parts or fix
bugs in EDE.  A knowledge of Emacs Lisp, and some EIEIO(CLOS) is
required.

   EDE uses EIEIO, the CLOS package for Emacs, to define two object
superclasses, specifically the PROJECT and TARGET.  All commands in EDE
are usually meant to address the current project, or current target.

   All specific projects in EDE derive subclasses of the EDE
superclasses.  In this way, specific behaviors such as how a project is
saved, or how a target is compiled can be customized by a project
author in detail.  EDE communicates to these project objects via an API
using methods.  The commands you use in EDE mode are high-level
functional wrappers over these methods.  *Note Top: (eieio)Top. For
details on using EIEIO to extending classes, and writing methods.

   If you intend to extend EDE, it is most likely that a new target
type is needed in one of the existing project types.  The rest of this
chapter will discuss extending the `ede-project' class, and it's
targets.  See `project-am.el' for basic details on adding targets to it.

   For the `ede-project' type, the core target class is called
`ede-proj-target'.  Inheriting from this will give you everything you
need to start, including adding your sources into the makefile.  If you
also need additional rules in the makefile, you will want to inherit
from `ede-proj-target-makefile' instead.  You may want to also add new
fields to track important information.

   If you are building currently unsupported code into a program or
shared library, it is unlikely you need a new target at all.  Instead
you would need to create a new compiler or linker object that compiles
source code of the desired type. *note Compiler and Linker objects::.

   Once your new class exists, you will want to fill in some basic
methods.  See the `ede-skel.el' file for examples of these.  The files
`ede-proj-info.el' and `ede-proj-elisp.el' are two interesting examples.

8.1 Development Overview
========================

EDE is made up of a series of classes implemented with EIEIO.  These
classes define an interface that can be used to create different types
of projects.

   EDE defines two superclasses which are `ede-project' and
`ede-target'.  All commands in EDE are usually meant to address the
current project, or current target.

   All specific projects in EDE derive subclasses of the EDE
superclasses.  In this way, specific behaviors such as how a project is
saved, or how a target is compiled can be customized by a project
author in detail.  EDE communicates to these project objects via an API
using methods.  The commands you use in EDE mode are high-level
functional wrappers over these methods.

   Some example project types are:

`project-am'
     Automake project which reads existing Automake files.

`ede-proj-project'
     This project type will create `Makefiles', or `Makefile.am' files
     to compile your project.

`ede-linux'
     This project type will detect linux source trees.

`ede-emacs'
     This project will detect an Emacs source tree.

   There are several other project types as well.

   The first class you need to know to create a new project type is
`ede-project-autoload'.  New instances of this class are needed to
define how Emacs associates different files/buffers with different
project types.  All the autoloads are kept in the variable
`ede-project-class-files'.

   The next most important class to know is `ede-project'.  This is the
baseclass defines how all projects behave.  The basic pattern for a
project is that there is one project per directory, and the topmost
project or directory defines the project as a whole.

   Key features of `ede-project' are things like name and version
number.  It also holds a list of `ede-target' objects and a list of sub
projects, or more `ede-project' objects.

   New project types must subclass `ede-project' to add special
behavior. New project types also need to subclass `ede-target' to add
specialty behavior.

   In this way, the common EDE interface is designed to work against
`ede-project', and thus all subclasses.

   `ede-project' subclasses `ede-project-placeholder'.  This is the
minimum necessary project needed to be cached between runs of Emacs.
This way, Emacs can track all projects ever seen, without loading those
projects into memory.

   Here is a high-level UML diagram for the EDE system created with
COGRE..

8.2 Detecting a Project
=======================

Project detection happens with the list of `ede-project-autoload'
instances stored in `ede-project-class-files'.  The full project
detection scheme works like this:

Step 1:
     `find-file-hook' calls `ede-turn-on-hook' on BUFFER.

Step 2:
     `ede-turn-on-hook' turns on `ede-minor-mode'

Step 3:
     `ede-minor-mode' looks to see if BUFFER is associated with any
     open projects.  If not, it calls `ede-load-project-file' to find a
     project associated with the current directory BUFFER is in.

Step 4:
     `ede-minor-mode' associates the found project with the current
     buffer with a series of variables, such as `ede-object', and
     `ede-object-project' and `ede-object-root-project'.

   Once a buffer is associated, EDE minor mode commands will operate on
that buffer.

   The function `ede-load-project-file' is at the heart of detecting
projects, and it works by looping over all the known project autoload
types in `ede-project-autoload' using the utility
`ede-directory-project-p'.

   The function `ede-directory-project-p' will call
`ede-dir-to-projectfile' on every `ede-project-autoload' until one of
them returns true.  The method `ede-dir-to-projectfile' in turn gets
the `:proj-file' slot from the autoload.  If it is a string (i.e., a
project file name), it checks to see if that exists in BUFFER's
directory.  If it is a function, then it calls that function and
expects it to return a file name or nil.  If the file exists, then this
directory is assumed to be part of a project, and
`ede-directory-project-p' returns the instance of
`ede-project-autoload' that matched.

   If the current directory contains the file `.ede-ignore' then that
directory is automatically assumed to contain no projects, even if
there is a matching pattern.  Use this type of file in a directory that
may contain many other sub projects, but still has a Makefile of some
sort.

   If the current directory is a project, then EDE scans upwards till
it finds the top of the project.  It does this by calling
`ede-toplevel-project'.  If this hasn't already been discovered, the
directories as scanned upward one at a time until a directory with no
project is found.  The last found project becomes the project root.  If
the found instance of `ede-project-autoload' has a valid `proj-root'
slot value, then that function is called instead of scanning the
project by hand.  Some project types have a short-cut for determining
the root of a project, so this comes in handy.

   Getting back to `ede-load-project-file', this now has an instance of
`ede-project-autoload'.  It uses the `load-type' slot to both autoload
in the project type, and to create a new instance of the project type
found for the root of the project.  That project is added to the global
list of all projects.  All subprojects are then created and assembled
into the project data structures.


File: ede.info,  Node: User interface methods,  Next: Base project methods,  Prev: Detecting a Project,  Up: Extending EDE

8.3 User interface methods
==========================

These methods are core behaviors associated with user commands.  If you
do not implement a method, there is a reasonable default that may do
what you need.

`project-add-file'
     Add a file to your project.  Override this if you want to put new
     sources into different fields depending on extension, or other
     details.

`project-remove-file'
     Reverse of project-add-file.

`project-compile-target'
     Override this if you want to do something special when the user
     "compiles" this target.

`project-debug-target'
     What to do when a user wants to debug your target.

8.4 Base project methods
========================

These methods are important for querying base information from project
and target types:

`ede-name'
     Return a string that is the name of this target.

`ede-target-name'
     Return a string that is the name of the target used by a Make
     system.

`ede-description'
     A brief description of the project or target.  This is currently
     used by the `ede-speedbar' interface.

`ede-want-file-p'
     Return non-nil if a target will accept a given file.  It is
     generally unnecessary to override this.  See the section on source
     code.

`ede-buffer-mine'
     Return non-nil if a buffer belongs to this target.  Used during
     association when a file is loaded.  It is generally unnecessary to
     override this unless you keep auxiliary files.

   These methods are used by the semantic package extensions.  *Note
Top: (semantic)Top.

`ede-buffer-header-file'
     Return a header file belonging to a given buffer.  Prototypes are
     place there when appropriate

`ede-buffer-documentation-files'
     Return the documentation file information about this file would be
     stored in.

`ede-documentation'
     List all documentation a project or target is responsible for.

8.5 Sourcecode objects
======================

EDE projects track source file / target associates via source code
objects.  The definitions for this is in `ede-source.el'.  A source
code object contains methods that know how to identify a file as being
of that class, (i.e., a C file ends with `.c').  Some targets can
handle many different types of sources which must all be compiled
together.  For example, a mixed C and C++ program would have
instantiations of both sourcecode types.

   When a target needs to know if it will accept a source file, it
references its list of source code objects.  These objects then make
that decision.

   Source code objects are stored in the target objects as a list of
symbols, where the symbol's value is the object.  This enables the
project save file mechanism to work.

   Here is an example for an instantiation of an Emacs Lisp source code
object:

     (defvar ede-source-emacs
       (ede-sourcecode "ede-emacs-source"
                       :name "Emacs Lisp"
                       :sourcepattern "\\.el$"
                       :garbagepattern '("*.elc"))
       "Emacs Lisp source code definition.")

   If you want to recycle parts of an existing sourcecode object, you
can clone the original, and then just tweak the parts that are
different.  For example:

     (defvar ede-source-emacs-autoload
       (clone ede-source-emacs "ede-source-emacs-autoload"
              :name "Emacs Lisp Autoload"
              :sourcepattern "-loaddefs\\.el")
       "Emacs Lisp autoload source code.")

   In this case, the garbage pattern is the same.

   *Note Sourcecode::.


File: ede.info,  Node: Compiler and Linker objects,  Next: Project,  Prev: Sourcecode objects,  Up: Extending EDE

8.6 Compiler and Linker objects
===============================

In order for a target to create a `Makefile', it must know how to
compile the sources into the program or desired data file, and possibly
link them together.

   A compiler object instantiation is used to associate a given target
with a given source code type.  Some targets can handle many types of
sources, and thus has many compilers available to it.  Some targets may
have multiple compilers for a given type of source code.

   EDE will examine the actual source files in a target, cross reference
that against the compiler list to come up with the final set of
compilers that will be inserted into the Makefile.

   Compiler instantiations must also insert variables specifying the
compiler it plans to use, in addition to creating Automake settings for
`configure.ac' when appropriate.

   Compiler objects are stored in the target objects as a list of
symbols, where the symbols value is the object.  This enables the
project output mechanism to work more efficiently.

   Targets will also have a special "compiler" slot which lets a user
explicitly choose the compiler they want to use.

   Here is an example for texinfo:

     (defvar ede-makeinfo-compiler
       (ede-compiler
        "ede-makeinfo-compiler"
        :name "makeinfo"
        :variables '(("MAKEINFO" . "makeinfo"))
        :commands '("makeinfo -o $ $<")
        :autoconf '(("AC_CHECK_PROG" . "MAKEINFO, makeinfo"))
        :sourcetype '(ede-makeinfo-source)
        )
       "Compile texinfo files into info files.")

   *Note Compilers::.

   When creating compiler instantiations, it may be useful to `clone'
an existing compiler variable.  Cloning allows you to only modify parts
of the original, while keeping the rest of the same.  Modification of
the original will result in the clone also being changed for shared
value slots.

   The second important object is the linker class.  The linker is
similar to the compiler, except several compilers might be used to
create some object files, and only one linker is used to link those
objects together.

   See `ede-proj-obj.el' for examples of the combination.

This class implements the `ede-cpp-root' project type.  *Note
ede-cpp-root::, for information about using this project type.

Slots:

    `:include-path'
          Type: `list'
          Default Value: `(quote ("/include" "../include/"))'

          The default locate function expands filenames within a
          project.  If a header file (.h, .hh, etc.) name is expanded,
          and the `:locate-fcn' slot is `nil', then the include path is
          checked first, and other directories are ignored.  For very
          large projects, this optimization can save a lot of time.

          Directory names in the path can be relative to the current
          buffer's `default-directory' (not starting with a /).
          Directories that are relative to the project's root should
          start with a /, such as  "/include", meaning the directory
          `include' off the project root directory.

    `:system-include-path'
          Type: `list'
          Default Value: `nil'

          The system include path for files in this project.  C files
          initialized in an ede-cpp-root-project have their semantic
          system include path set to this value.  If this is `nil',
          then the semantic path is not modified.

    `:spp-table'
          Type: `list'
          Default Value: `nil'

          C Preprocessor macros for your files.  Preprocessor symbols
          will be used while parsing your files.  These macros might be
          passed in through the command line compiler, or are critical
          symbols derived from header files.  Providing header files
          macro values through this slot improves accuracy and
          performance.  Use `:spp-files' to use these files directly.

    `:spp-files'
          Type: `list'
          Default Value: `nil'

          C header file with Preprocessor macros for your files.  The
          PreProcessor symbols appearing in these files will be used
          while parsing files in this project.  See
          `semantic-lex-c-preprocessor-symbol-map' for more on how this
          works.

    `:header-match-regexp'
          Type: `string'
          Default Value:
          `"\\.\\(h\\(h\\|xx\\|pp\\|\\+\\+\\)?\\|H\\)$\\|\\<\\w+$"'

          Regexp used to identify C/C++ header files.

    `:locate-fcn'
          Type: `(or null function)'
          Default Value: `nil'

          The locate function can be used in place of
          "ede-expand-filename" so you can quickly customize your
          custom target to use specialized local routines instead of
          the EDE routines.  The function symbol must take two
          arguments:   NAME - The name of the file to find.    DIR -
          The directory root for this cpp-root project.

          It should return the fully qualified file name passed in from
          NAME.  If that file does not exist, it should return nil.

    `:makefile-type'
          Type: `symbol'
          Default Value: `Makefile'

          The type of Makefile to generate.  Can be one of `'Makefile',
          'Makefile.in, or 'Makefile.am.  If this value is NOT
          `'Makefile', then that overrides the `:makefile' slot in
          targets.

    `:variables'
          Type: `list'
          Default Value: `nil'

          Variables to set in this Makefile.

    `:configuration-variables'
          Type: `list'
          Default Value: `("debug" (("DEBUG" . "1")))'

          Makefile variables to use in different configurations.  These
          variables are used in the makefile when a configuration
          becomes active.

    `:inference-rules
          '
          Default Value: `nil'

          Inference rules to add to the makefile.

    `:include-file

          projects are grouped into a large project not maintained by
          EDE, then you need to set this to non-nil.  The only effect
          is that the `dist' rule will then avoid making a tar file.

          function to call to initialize automake to use this compiler.
          For example, there may be multiple C compilers, but they all
          probably use the same autoconf form.

    `:objectextention'
          Type: `string'

          A string which is the extension used for object files.  For

     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You
     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
     way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
     and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from
     you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and
     not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of
     the same material does not give you any rights to use it.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy
     can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

 11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
