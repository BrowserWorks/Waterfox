1 Introduction
**************

nXML mode is an Emacs major-mode for editing XML documents.  It supports
editing well-formed XML documents, and provides schema-sensitive editing
using RELAX NG Compact Syntax.  To get started, visit a file containing
an XML document, and, if necessary, use `M-x nxml-mode' to switch to
nXML mode.  By default, `auto-mode-alist' and `magic-fallback-alist'
put buffers in nXML mode if they have recognizable XML content or file
extensions.  You may wish to customize the settings, for example to
recognize different file extensions.

   Once in nXML mode, you can type `C-h m' for basic information on the
mode.

   The `etc/nxml' directory in the Emacs distribution contains some data
files used by nXML mode, and includes two files (`test-valid.xml' and
`test-invalid.xml') that provide examples of valid and invalid XML
documents.

   To get validation and schema-sensitive editing, you need a RELAX NG
Compact Syntax (RNC) schema for your document (*note Locating a
schema::).  The `etc/schema' directory includes some schemas for
popular document types.  See `http://relaxng.org/' for more information
on RELAX NG.  You can use the `Trang' program from
`http://www.thaiopensource.com/relaxng/trang.html' to automatically
create RNC schemas.  This program can:

   * infer an RNC schema from an instance document;

   * convert a DTD to an RNC schema;

   * convert a RELAX NG XML syntax schema to an RNC schema.

To convert a RELAX NG XML syntax (`.rng') schema to a RNC one, you can
also use the XSLT stylesheet from `http://www.pantor.com/download.html'.

   To convert a W3C XML Schema to an RNC schema, you need first to
convert it to RELAX NG XML syntax using the RELAX NG converter tool
`rngconv' (built on top of MSV).  See `https://github.com/kohsuke/msv'
and `https://msv.dev.java.net/'.

   For historical discussions only, see the mailing list archives at
`http://groups.yahoo.com/group/emacs-nxml-mode/'.  Please make all new

2 Completion
************

Apart from real-time validation, the most important feature that nXML
mode provides for assisting in document creation is "completion".
Completion assists the user in inserting characters at point, based on
knowledge of the schema and on the contents of the buffer before point.

   nXML mode adapts the standard GNU Emacs command for completion in a
buffer: `completion-at-point', which is bound to `C-M-i' and `M-<TAB>'.
Note that many window systems and window managers use `M-<TAB>'
themselves (typically for switching between windows) and do not pass it
to applications.  In that case, you should type `C-M-i' or `<ESC>
<TAB>' for completion, or bind `completion-at-point' to a key that is
convenient for you.  In the following, I will assume that you type
`C-M-i'.

   nXML mode completion works by examining the symbol preceding point.
This is the symbol to be completed. The symbol to be completed may be
the empty. Completion considers what symbols starting with the symbol
to be completed would be valid replacements for the symbol to be
completed, given the schema and the contents of the buffer before
point.  These symbols are the possible completions.  An example may
make this clearer.  Suppose the buffer looks like this (where -!-
indicates point):

     <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
     <h-!-

and the schema is XHTML.  In this context, the symbol to be completed
is `h'.  The possible completions consist of just `head'.  Another
example, is

     <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
     <head>
     <-!-

In this case, the symbol to be completed is empty, and the possible
completions are `base', `isindex', `link', `meta', `script', `style',
`title'.  Another example is:

     <html xmlns="-!-

In this case, the symbol to be completed is empty, and the possible
completions are just `http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'.

   When you type `C-M-i', what happens depends on what the set of
possible completions are.

   * If the set of completions is empty, nothing happens.

   * If there is one possible completion, then that completion is
     inserted, together with any following characters that are
     required. For example, in this case:

          <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
          <-!-

     `C-M-i' will yield

          <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
          <head-!-

   * If there is more than one possible completion, but all possible
     completions share a common non-empty prefix, then that prefix is
     inserted. For example, suppose the buffer is:

          <html x-!-

     The symbol to be completed is `x'. The possible completions are
     `xmlns' and `xml:lang'.  These share a common prefix of `xml'.
     Thus, `C-M-i' will yield:

          <html xml-!-

     Typically, you would do `C-M-i' again, which would have the result
     described in the next item.

   * If there is more than one possible completion, but the possible
     completions do not share a non-empty prefix, then Emacs will
     prompt you to input the symbol in the minibuffer, initializing the
     minibuffer with the symbol to be completed, and popping up a buffer
     showing the possible completions.  You can now input the symbol to
     be inserted.  The symbol you input will be inserted in the buffer
     instead of the symbol to be completed.  Emacs will then insert any
     required characters after the symbol.  For example, if it contains:

          <html xml-!-

     Emacs will prompt you in the minibuffer with

          Attribute: xml-!-

     and the buffer showing possible completions will contain

          Possible completions are:
          xml:lang                           xmlns

     If you input `xmlns', the result will be:

          <html xmlns="-!-

     (If you do `C-M-i' again, the namespace URI will be inserted.
     Should that happen automatically?)


File: nxml-mode.info,  Node: Inserting end-tags,  Next: Paragraphs,  Prev: Completion,  Up: Top

3 Inserting end-tags
********************

The main redundancy in XML syntax is end-tags.  nXML mode provides
several ways to make it easier to enter end-tags.  You can use all of
these without a schema.

   You can use `C-M-i' after `</' to complete the rest of the end-tag.

   `C-c C-f' inserts an end-tag for the element containing point. This
command is useful when you want to input the start-tag, then input the
content and finally input the end-tag. The `f' is mnemonic for finish.

   If you want to keep tags balanced and input the end-tag at the same
time as the start-tag, before inputting the content, then you can use
`C-c C-i'. This inserts a `>', then inserts the end-tag and leaves
point before the end-tag.  `C-c C-b' is similar but more convenient for
block-level elements: it puts the start-tag, point and the end-tag on
successive lines, appropriately indented. The `i' is mnemonic for
inline and the `b' is mnemonic for block.

   Finally, you can customize nXML mode so that `/' automatically
inserts the rest of the end-tag when it occurs after `<', by doing

     `M-x customize-variable <RET> nxml-slash-auto-complete-flag <RET>'

and then following the instructions in the displayed buffer.

4 Paragraphs
************

Emacs has several commands that operate on paragraphs, most notably
`M-q'. nXML mode redefines these to work in a way that is useful for
XML.  The exact rules that are used to find the beginning and end of a
paragraph are complicated; they are designed mainly to ensure that
`M-q' does the right thing.

   A paragraph consists of one or more complete, consecutive lines.  A
group of lines is not considered a paragraph unless it contains some
non-whitespace characters between tags or inside comments.  A blank
line separates paragraphs.  A single tag on a line by itself also
separates paragraphs.  More precisely, if one tag together with any
leading and trailing whitespace completely occupy one or more lines,
then those lines will not be included in any paragraph.

   A start-tag at the beginning of the line (possibly indented) may be
treated as starting a paragraph.  Similarly, an end-tag at the end of
the line may be treated as ending a paragraph. The following rules are
used to determine whether such a tag is in fact treated as a paragraph
boundary:

   * If the schema does not allow text at that point, then it is a
     paragraph boundary.

   * If the end-tag corresponding to the start-tag is not at the end of
     its line, or the start-tag corresponding to the end-tag is not at
     the beginning of its line, then it is not a paragraph boundary.
     For example, in

          <p>This is a paragraph with an
          <emph>emphasized</emph> phrase.

     the `<emph>' start-tag would not be considered as starting a
     paragraph, because its corresponding end-tag is not at the end of
     the line.

   * If there is text that is a sibling in element tree, then it is not
     a paragraph boundary.  For example, in

          <p>This is a paragraph with an
          <emph>emphasized phrase that takes one source line</emph>

     the `<emph>' start-tag would not be considered as starting a
     paragraph, even though its end-tag is at the end of its line,
     because there the text `This is a paragraph with an' is a sibling
     of the `emph' element.

   * Otherwise, it is a paragraph boundary.

5 Outlining
***********

nXML mode allows you to display all or part of a buffer as an outline,
in a similar way to Emacs's outline mode.  An outline in nXML mode is
based on recognizing two kinds of element: sections and headings.
There is one heading for every section and one section for every
heading.  A section contains its heading as or within its first child
element.  A section also contains its subordinate sections (its
subsections).  The text content of a section consists of anything in a
section that is neither a subsection nor a heading.

   Note that this is a different model from that used by XHTML.  nXML
mode's outline support will not be useful for XHTML unless you adopt a
convention of adding a `div' to enclose each section, rather than
having sections implicitly delimited by different `hN' elements.  This
limitation may be removed in a future version.

   The variable `nxml-section-element-name-regexp' gives a regexp for
the local names (i.e., the part of the name following any prefix) of
section elements. The variable `nxml-heading-element-name-regexp' gives
a regexp for the local names of heading elements. For an element to be
recognized as a section

   * its start-tag must occur at the beginning of a line (possibly
     indented);

   * its local name must match `nxml-section-element-name-regexp';

   * either its first child element or a descendant of that first child
     element must have a local name that matches
     `nxml-heading-element-name-regexp'; the first such element is
     treated as the section's heading.

You can customize these variables using `M-x customize-variable'.

   There are three possible outline states for a section:

   * normal, showing everything, including its heading, text content
     and subsections; each subsection is displayed according to the
     state of that subsection;

   * showing just its heading, with both its text content and its
     subsections hidden; all subsections are hidden regardless of their
     state;

   * showing its heading and its subsections, with its text content
     hidden; each subsection is displayed according to the state of
     that subsection.

   In the last two states, where the text content is hidden, the
heading is displayed specially, in an abbreviated form. An element like
this:

     <section>
     <title>Food</title>
     <para>There are many kinds of food.</para>
     </section>

would be displayed on a single line like this:

     <-section>Food...</>

If there are hidden subsections, then a `+' will be used instead of a
`-' like this:

     <+section>Food...</>

If there are non-hidden subsections, then the section will instead be
displayed like this:

     <-section>Food...
       <-section>Delicious Food...</>
       <-section>Distasteful Food...</>
     </-section>

The heading is always displayed with an indent that corresponds to its
depth in the outline, even it is not actually indented in the buffer.
The variable `nxml-outline-child-indent' controls how much a subheading
is indented with respect to its parent heading when the heading is
being displayed specially.

   Commands to change the outline state of sections are bound to key
sequences that start with `C-c C-o' (`o' is mnemonic for outline).  The
third and final key has been chosen to be consistent with outline mode.
In the following descriptions current section means the section
containing point, or, more precisely, the innermost section containing
the character immediately following point.

   * `C-c C-o C-a' shows all sections in the buffer normally.

   * `C-c C-o C-t' hides the text content of all sections in the buffer.

   * `C-c C-o C-c' hides the text content of the current section.

   * `C-c C-o C-e' shows the text content of the current section.

   * `C-c C-o C-d' hides the text content and subsections of the
     current section.

   * `C-c C-o C-s' shows the current section and all its direct and
     indirect subsections normally.

   * `C-c C-o C-k' shows the headings of the direct and indirect
     subsections of the current section.

   * `C-c C-o C-l' hides the text content of the current section and of
     its direct and indirect subsections.

   * `C-c C-o C-i' shows the headings of the direct subsections of the
     current section.

   * `C-c C-o C-o' hides as much as possible without hiding the current
     section's text content; the headings of ancestor sections of the
     current section and their child section sections will not be
     hidden.

   When a heading is displayed specially, you can use <RET> in that
heading to show the text content of the section in the same way as `C-c
C-o C-e'.

   You can also use the mouse to change the outline state: `S-mouse-2'
hides the text content of a section in the same way as`C-c C-o C-c';
`mouse-2' on a specially displayed heading shows the text content of
the section in the same way as `C-c C-o C-e'; `mouse-1' on a specially
displayed start-tag toggles the display of subheadings on and off.

   The outline state for each section is stored with the first
character of the section (as a text property). Every command that
changes the outline state of any section updates the display of the
buffer so that each section is displayed correctly according to its
outline state.  If the section structure is subsequently changed, then
it is possible for the display to no longer correctly reflect the
stored outline state. `C-c C-o C-r' can be used to refresh the display
so it is correct again.

6 Locating a schema
*******************

nXML mode has a configurable set of rules to locate a schema for the
file being edited.  The rules are contained in one or more schema
locating files, which are XML documents.

   The variable `rng-schema-locating-files' specifies the list of the
file-names of schema locating files that nXML mode should use.  The
order of the list is significant: when file X occurs in the list before
file Y then rules from file X have precedence over rules from file Y.
A filename specified in `rng-schema-locating-files' may be relative. If
so, it will be resolved relative to the document for which a schema is
being located. It is not an error if relative file-names in
`rng-schema-locating-files' do not exist. You can use `M-x
customize-variable <RET> rng-schema-locating-files <RET>' to customize
the list of schema locating files.

   By default, `rng-schema-locating-files' list has two members:
`schemas.xml', and `DIST-DIR/schema/schemas.xml' where `DIST-DIR' is
the directory containing the nXML distribution. The first member will
cause nXML mode to use a file `schemas.xml' in the same directory as
the document being edited if such a file exist.  The second member
contains rules for the schemas that are included with the nXML
distribution.

6.1 Commands for locating a schema
==================================

The command `C-c C-s C-w' will tell you what schema is currently being
used.

   The rules for locating a schema are applied automatically when you
visit a file in nXML mode. However, if you have just created a new file
and the schema cannot be inferred from the file-name, then this will
not locate the right schema.  In this case, you should insert the
start-tag of the root element and then use the command `C-c C-s C-a',
which reapplies the rules based on the current content of the document.
It is usually not necessary to insert the complete start-tag; often
just `<NAME' is enough.

   If you want to use a schema that has not yet been added to the
schema locating files, you can use the command `C-c C-s C-f' to
manually select the file containing the schema for the document in
current buffer.  Emacs will read the file-name of the schema from the
minibuffer. After reading the file-name, Emacs will ask whether you
wish to add a rule to a schema locating file that persistently
associates the document with the selected schema.  The rule will be
added to the first file in the list specified
`rng-schema-locating-files'; it will create the file if necessary, but
will not create a directory. If the variable
`rng-schema-locating-files' has not been customized, this means that
the rule will be added to the file `schemas.xml' in the same directory
as the document being edited.

   The command `C-c C-s C-t' allows you to select a schema by
specifying an identifier for the type of the document.  The schema
locating files determine the available type identifiers and what schema
is used for each type identifier. This is useful when it is impossible
to infer the right schema from either the file-name or the content of
the document, even though the schema is already in the schema locating
file.  A situation in which this can occur is when there are multiple
variants of a schema where all valid documents have the same document
element.  For example, XHTML has Strict and Transitional variants.  In
a situation like this, a schema locating file can define a type
identifier for each variant. As with `C-c C-s C-f', Emacs will ask
whether you wish to add a rule to a schema locating file that
persistently associates the document with the specified type identifier.

   The command `C-c C-s C-l' adds a rule to a schema locating file that
persistently associates the document with the schema that is currently
being used.

6.2 Schema locating files
=========================

Each schema locating file specifies a list of rules.  The rules from
each file are appended in order. To locate a schema each rule is
applied in turn until a rule matches.  The first matching rule is then
used to determine the schema.

   Schema locating files are designed to be useful for other
applications that need to locate a schema for a document. In fact,
there is nothing specific to locating schemas in the design; it could
equally well be used for locating a stylesheet.

File: nxml-mode.info,  Node: Schema locating file syntax basics,  Next: Using the document's URI to locate a schema,  Up: Schema locating files

6.2.1 Schema locating file syntax basics
----------------------------------------

There is a schema for schema locating files in the file `locate.rnc' in
the schema directory.  Schema locating files must be valid with respect
to this schema.

   The document element of a schema locating file must be
`locatingRules' and the namespace URI must be
`http://thaiopensource.com/ns/locating-rules/1.0'.  The children of the
document element specify rules. The order of the children is the same
as the order of the rules.  Here's a complete example of a schema
locating file:

     <?xml version="1.0"?>
     <locatingRules xmlns="http://thaiopensource.com/ns/locating-rules/1.0">
       <namespace ns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" uri="xhtml.rnc"/>
       <documentElement localName="book" uri="docbook.rnc"/>
     </locatingRules>

This says to use the schema `xhtml.rnc' for a document with namespace
`http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml', and to use the schema `docbook.rnc' for
a document whose local name is `book'.  If the document element had
both a namespace URI of `http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml' and a local name
of `book', then the matching rule that comes first will be used and so
the schema `xhtml.rnc' would be used.  There is no precedence between
different types of rule; the first matching rule of any type is used.

   As usual with XML-related technologies, resources are identified by
URIs.  The `uri' attribute identifies the schema by specifying the URI.
The URI may be relative.  If so, it is resolved relative to the URI of
the schema locating file that contains attribute. This means that if
the value of `uri' attribute does not contain a `/', then it will refer
to a filename in the same directory as the schema locating file.

6.2.2 Using the document's URI to locate a schema
-------------------------------------------------

A `uri' rule locates a schema based on the URI of the document.  The
`uri' attribute specifies the URI of the schema.  The `resource'
attribute can be used to specify the schema for a particular document.
For example,

     <uri resource="spec.xml" uri="docbook.rnc"/>

specifies that the schema for `spec.xml' is `docbook.rnc'.

   The `pattern' attribute can be used instead of the `resource'
attribute to specify the schema for any document whose URI matches a
pattern.  The pattern has the same syntax as an absolute or relative
URI except that the path component of the URI can use a `*' character
to stand for zero or more characters within a path segment (i.e., any
character other `/').  Typically, the URI pattern looks like a relative
URI, but, whereas a relative URI in the `resource' attribute is
resolved into a particular absolute URI using the base URI of the
schema locating file, a relative URI pattern matches if it matches some
number of complete path segments of the document's URI ending with the
last path segment of the document's URI. For example,

     <uri pattern="*.xsl" uri="xslt.rnc"/>

specifies that the schema for documents with a URI whose path ends with
`.xsl' is `xslt.rnc'.

   A `transformURI' rule locates a schema by transforming the URI of
the document. The `fromPattern' attribute specifies a URI pattern with
the same meaning as the `pattern' attribute of the `uri' element.  The
`toPattern' attribute is a URI pattern that is used to generate the URI
of the schema.  Each `*' in the `toPattern' is replaced by the string
that matched the corresponding `*' in the `fromPattern'.  The resulting
string is appended to the initial part of the document's URI that was
not explicitly matched by the `fromPattern'.  The rule matches only if
the transformed URI identifies an existing resource.  For example, the
rule

     <transformURI fromPattern="*.xml" toPattern="*.rnc"/>

would transform the URI `file:///home/jjc/docs/spec.xml' into the URI
`file:///home/jjc/docs/spec.rnc'.  Thus, this rule specifies that to
locate a schema for a document `FOO.xml', Emacs should test whether a
file `FOO.rnc' exists in the same directory as `FOO.xml', and, if so,
should use it as the schema.

6.2.3 Using the document element to locate a schema
---------------------------------------------------

A `documentElement' rule locates a schema based on the local name and
prefix of the document element. For example, a rule

     <documentElement prefix="xsl" localName="stylesheet" uri="xslt.rnc"/>

specifies that when the name of the document element is
`xsl:stylesheet', then `xslt.rnc' should be used as the schema. Either
the `prefix' or `localName' attribute may be omitted to allow any
prefix or local name.

   A `namespace' rule locates a schema based on the namespace URI of
the document element. For example, a rule

     <namespace ns="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" uri="xslt.rnc"/>

specifies that when the namespace URI of the document is
`http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform', then `xslt.rnc' should be used
as the schema.

6.2.4 Using type identifiers in schema locating files
-----------------------------------------------------

Type identifiers allow a level of indirection in locating the schema
for a document.  Instead of associating the document directly with a
schema URI, the document is associated with a type identifier, which is
in turn associated with a schema URI. nXML mode does not constrain the
format of type identifiers.  They can be simply strings without any
formal structure or they can be public identifiers or URIs.  Note that
these type identifiers have nothing to do with the DOCTYPE declaration.
When comparing type identifiers, whitespace is normalized in the same
way as with the `xsd:token' datatype: leading and trailing whitespace
is stripped; other sequences of whitespace are normalized to a single
space character.

   Each of the rules described in previous sections that uses a `uri'
attribute to specify a schema, can instead use a `typeId' attribute to
specify a type identifier.  The type identifier can be associated with
a URI using a `typeId' element. For example,

     <locatingRules xmlns="http://thaiopensource.com/ns/locating-rules/1.0">
       <namespace ns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" typeId="XHTML"/>
       <typeId id="XHTML" typeId="XHTML Strict"/>
       <typeId id="XHTML Strict" uri="xhtml-strict.rnc"/>
       <typeId id="XHTML Transitional" uri="xhtml-transitional.rnc"/>
     </locatingRules>

declares three type identifiers `XHTML' (representing the default
variant of XHTML to be used), `XHTML Strict' and `XHTML Transitional'.
Such a schema locating file would use `xhtml-strict.rnc' for a document
whose namespace is `http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'.  But it is
considerably more flexible than a schema locating file that simply
specified

     <namespace ns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" uri="xhtml-strict.rnc"/>

A user can easily use `C-c C-s C-t' to select between XHTML Strict and
XHTML Transitional. Also, a user can easily add a catalog

     <locatingRules xmlns="http://thaiopensource.com/ns/locating-rules/1.0">
       <typeId id="XHTML" typeId="XHTML Transitional"/>
     </locatingRules>

that makes the default variant of XHTML be XHTML Transitional.


File: nxml-mode.info,  Node: Using multiple schema locating files,  Prev: Using type identifiers in schema locating files,  Up: Schema locating files

6.2.5 Using multiple schema locating files
------------------------------------------

The `include' element includes rules from another schema locating file.
The behavior is exactly as if the rules from that file were included in
place of the `include' element.  Relative URIs are resolved into
absolute URIs before the inclusion is performed. For example,

     <include rules="../rules.xml"/>

includes the rules from `rules.xml'.

   The process of locating a schema takes as input a list of schema
locating files.  The rules in all these files and in the files they
include are resolved into a single list of rules, which are applied
strictly in order.  Sometimes this order is not what is needed.  For
example, suppose you have two schema locating files, a private file

     <locatingRules xmlns="http://thaiopensource.com/ns/locating-rules/1.0">
       <namespace ns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" uri="xhtml.rnc"/>
     </locatingRules>

followed by a public file

     <locatingRules xmlns="http://thaiopensource.com/ns/locating-rules/1.0">
       <transformURI pathSuffix=".xml" replacePathSuffix=".rnc"/>
       <namespace ns="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" typeId="XSLT"/>
     </locatingRules>

The effect of these two files is that the XHTML `namespace' rule takes
precedence over the `transformURI' rule, which is almost certainly not
what is needed.  This can be solved by adding an `applyFollowingRules'
to the private file.

     <locatingRules xmlns="http://thaiopensource.com/ns/locating-rules/1.0">
       <applyFollowingRules ruleType="transformURI"/>
       <namespace ns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" uri="xhtml.rnc"/>
     </locatingRules>

7 DTDs
******

nXML mode is designed to support the creation of standalone XML
documents that do not depend on a DTD.  Although it is common practice
to insert a DOCTYPE declaration referencing an external DTD, this has
undesirable side-effects.  It means that the document is no longer
self-contained. It also means that different XML parsers may interpret
the document in different ways, since the XML Recommendation does not
require XML parsers to read the DTD.  With DTDs, it was impractical to
get validation without using an external DTD or reference to an
parameter entity.  With RELAX NG and other schema languages, you can
simultaneously get the benefits of validation and standalone XML
documents.  Therefore, I recommend that you do not reference an
external DOCTYPE in your XML documents.

   One problem is entities for characters. Typically, as well as
providing validation, DTDs also provide a set of character entities for
documents to use. Schemas cannot provide this functionality, because
schema validation happens after XML parsing.  The recommended solution
is to either use the Unicode characters directly, or, if this is
impractical, use character references.  nXML mode supports this by
providing commands for entering characters and character references
using the Unicode names, and can display the glyph corresponding to a
character reference.

8 Limitations
*************

nXML mode has some limitations:

   * DTD support is limited.  Internal parsed general entities declared
     in the internal subset are supported provided they do not contain
     elements. Other usage of DTDs is ignored.

   * The restrictions on RELAX NG schemas in section 7 of the RELAX NG
     specification are not enforced.

Appendix A GNU Free Documentation License
*****************************************

                     Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

     Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008, 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     `http://fsf.org/'

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You
     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
     way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
     and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from
     you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and
     not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of
     the same material does not give you any rights to use it.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy

 11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
