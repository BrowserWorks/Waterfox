Editing with multiple windows and buffers.		*windows* *buffers*

The commands which have been added to use multiple windows and buffers are
explained here.  Additionally, there are explanations for commands that work
differently when used in combination with more than one window.

2.  Starting Vim			|windows-starting|
3.  Opening and closing a window	|opening-window|
4.  Moving cursor to other windows	|window-move-cursor|

{Vi does not have any of these commands}

==============================================================================
1. Introduction						*windows-intro*

A window is a viewport onto a buffer.  You can use multiple windows on one
buffer, or several windows on different buffers.

A buffer is a file loaded into memory for editing.  The original file remains
unchanged until you write the buffer to the file.

A buffer can be in one of three states:

							*active-buffer*
active:   The buffer is displayed in a window.  If there is a file for this
	  buffer, it has been read into the buffer.  The buffer may have been
	  modified.
							*hidden-buffer*
hidden:   The buffer is not displayed.  If there is a file for this buffer, it
	  has been read into the buffer.  The buffer may have been modified.
							*inactive-buffer*
inactive: The buffer is not displayed and does not contain anything.  Options
	  for the buffer are remembered if the file was once loaded.

In a table:

state		displayed	loaded		":buffers"  ~
		in window			shows	    ~
active		  yes		 yes		  ' '
hidden		  no		 yes		  'h'
inactive	  no		 no		  '-'

==============================================================================
2. Starting Vim						*windows-starting*

By default, Vim starts with one window, just like Vi.

The "-o" argument to Vim can be used to open a window for each file in the
argument list: "Vim -o file1 file2 file3" will open three windows.

"-oN", where N is a decimal number, opens N windows.  If there are more
file names than windows, only N windows are opened and some files do not get a
window.  If there are more windows than file names, the last few windows will
be editing empty buffers.

If there are many file names, the windows will become very small.  You might
want to set the 'winheight' option to create a workable situation.

Buf/Win Enter/Leave autocommands are not executed when opening the new windows
and reading the files, that's only done when they are really entered.

							*status-line*
A status line will be used to separate windows.  The 'laststatus' option tells
when the last window also has a status line:
	'laststatus' = 0	never a status line
	'laststatus' = 1	status line if there is more than one window
	'laststatus' = 2	always a status line

You can change the contents of the status line with the 'statusline' option.

Normally, inversion is used to display the status line.  This can be changed
with the 's' character in the 'highlight' option.  For example, "sb" sets it to
bold characters.  If no highlighting is used for the status line ("sn"), the
'^' character is used for the current window, and '=' for other windows.  If
the mouse is supported and enabled with the 'mouse' option, a status line can
be dragged to resize windows.

Note: If you expect your status line to be in reverse video and it isn't,
check if the 'highlight' option contains "si".  In version 3.0, this meant to
invert the status line.  Now it should be "sr", reverse the status line, as
"si" now stands for italic!  If italic is not available on your terminal, the
status line is inverted anyway; you will only see this problem on terminals
that have termcap codes for italics.

==============================================================================
3. Opening and closing a window				*opening-window*

CTRL-W s						*CTRL-W_s*
CTRL-W S						*CTRL-W_S*
CTRL-W CTRL-S						*CTRL-W_CTRL-S*
:[N]sp[lit] [+cmd]					*:sp* *:split*
		Split current window in two.  The result is two viewports on
		the same file.  Make new window N high (default is to use half
		the height of the current window).  Reduces the current window
		height to create room (and others, if the 'equalalways' option
		is set).  (Note: CTRL-S does not work on all terminals).  Also
		see |+cmd|.

CTRL-W n						*CTRL-W_n*
CTRL-W CTRL_N						*CTRL-W_CTRL-N*
:[N]new [+cmd]						*:new*
		Create a new window and start editing an empty file in it.
		Make new window N high (default is to use half the existing
		height).  Reduces the current window height to create room (and
		others, if the 'equalalways' option is set).  Also see
		|+cmd|.  If 'fileformats' is not empty, the first format given
		will be used for the new buffer.  If 'fileformats' is empty,
		the 'fileformat' of the current buffer is used.
		Autocommands are executed in this order:
		1. WinLeave for the current window
		2. WinEnter for the new window
		3. BufLeave for the current buffer
		4. BufEnter for the new buffer
		This behaves like a ":split" first, and then a ":e" command.

:[N]new [+cmd] {file}
:[N]sp[lit] [+cmd] {file}				*:split_f*
		Create a new window and start editing file {file} in it.  If
		[+cmd] is given, execute the command when the file has been
		loaded |+cmd|.  Make new window N high (default is to use half
		the existing height).  Reduces the current window height to
		create room (and others, if the 'equalalways' option is set).

:[N]sv[iew] [+cmd] {file}			*:sv* *:sview* *splitview*
		Same as ":split", but set 'readonly' option for this buffer.

:[N]sf[ind] [+cmd] {file}			*:sf* *:sfind* *splitfind*
		Same as ":split", but search for {file} in 'path'.  Doesn't
		split if {file} is not found.

CTRL-W CTRL-^					*CTRL-W_CTRL-^* *CTRL-W_^*
CTRL-W ^	Does ":split #", split window in two and edit alternate file.
		When a count is given, it becomes ":split #N", split window
		and edit buffer N.

Closing a window
----------------

CTRL-W q						*CTRL-W_q*
CTRL-W CTRL-Q						*CTRL-W_CTRL-Q*
:q[uit]		Quit current window.  When quitting the last window (not
		counting a help window), exit Vim.
		When 'hidden' is set, and there is only one window for the
		current buffer, it becomes hidden.
		When 'hidden' is not set, and there is only one window for the
		current buffer, and the buffer was changed, the command fails.
		(Note: CTRL-Q does not work on all terminals)

:q[uit]!	Quit current window.  If this was the last window for a buffer,
		any changes to that buffer are lost.  When quitting the last
		window (not counting help windows), exit Vim.  The contents of
		the buffer are lost, even when 'hidden' is set.

CTRL-W c					*CTRL-W_c* *:clo* *:close*
:clo[se][!]	Close current window.  When the 'hidden' option is set, or
		when the buffer was changed and the [!] is used, the buffer
		becomes hidden (unless there is another window editing it).
		This command fails when:
		- There is only one window on the screen.
		- When 'hidden' is not set, [!] is not used, the buffer has
		  changes, and there is no other window on this buffer.
		Changes to the buffer are not written and won't get lost, so
		this is a "safe" command.

CTRL-W CTRL-C						*CTRL-W_CTRL-C*
		You might have expected that CTRL-W CTRL-C closes the current
		window, but that does not work, because the CTRL-C cancels the
		command.

							*:hide*
:hid[e]		Quit current window, unless it is the last window on the
		screen.  The buffer becomes hidden (unless there is another
		window editing it).
		The value of 'hidden' is irrelevant for this command.
		Changes to the buffer are not written and won't get lost, so
		this is a "safe" command.

CTRL-W o						*CTRL-W_o*
CTRL-W CTRL-O					*CTRL-W_CTRL-O* *:on* *:only*
:on[ly][!]	Make the current window the only one on the screen.  All other
		windows are closed.
		When the 'hidden' option is set, all buffers in closed windows
		become hidden.
		When 'hidden' is not set, and the 'autowrite' option is set,
		modified buffers are written.  Otherwise, windows that have
		buffers that are modified are not removed, unless the [!] is
		given, then they become hidden.  But modified buffers are
		never abandoned, so changes cannot get lost.

==============================================================================
4. Moving cursor to other windows			*window-move-cursor*

CTRL-W <Down>					*CTRL-W_<Down>*
CTRL-W CTRL-J					*CTRL-W_CTRL-J* *CTRL-W_j*
CTRL-W j	move cursor to Nth window below current one.

CTRL-W <Up>					*CTRL-W_<Up>*
CTRL-W CTRL-K					*CTRL-W_CTRL-K* *CTRL-W_k*
CTRL-W k	move cursor to Nth window above current one.

CTRL-W w					*CTRL-W_w* *CTRL-W_CTRL-W*
CTRL-W CTRL-W	Without count: move cursor to window below current one.  If
		there is no window below, go to top window.
		With count: go to Nth window.

						*CTRL-W_W*
CTRL-W W	Without count: move cursor to window above current one.  If
		there is no window above, go to bottom window.
		With count: go to Nth window.

CTRL-W t					*CTRL-W_t* *CTRL-W_CTRL-T*
CTRL-W CTRL-T	move cursor to top window.

CTRL-W b					*CTRL-W_b* *CTRL-W_CTRL-B*
CTRL-W CTRL-B	move cursor to bottom window.

CTRL-W p					*CTRL-W_p* *CTRL-W_CTRL-P*
CTRL-W CTRL-P	go to previous (last accessed) window.

If Visual mode is active and the new window is not for the same buffer, the
Visual mode is ended.

==============================================================================
5. Moving windows around				*window-moving*

CTRL-W r					*CTRL-W_r* *CTRL-W_CTRL-R*
CTRL-W CTRL-R	Rotate windows downwards.  The first window becomes the second
		one, the second one becomes the third one, etc.  The last
		window becomes the first window.  The cursor remains in the
		same window.

						*CTRL-W_R*
CTRL-W R	Rotate windows upwards.  The second window becomes the first
		one, the third one becomes the second one, etc.  The first
		window becomes the last window.  The cursor remains in the
		same window.

CTRL-W x					*CTRL-W_x* *CTRL-W_CTRL-X*
CTRL-W CTRL-X	Without count: Exchange current window with next one.  If there
		is no next window, exchange with previous window.
		With count: Exchange current window with Nth window (first
		window is 1).  The cursor is put in the other window.

==============================================================================
6. Window resizing					*window-resize*

						*CTRL-W_=*
CTRL-W =	make all windows (almost) equally high.

:res[ize] -N					*:res* *:resize* *CTRL-W_-*
CTRL-W -	decrease current window height by N

:res[ize] +N					*CTRL-W_+*
CTRL-W +	increase current window height by N

:res[ize] [N]
CTRL-W CTRL-_					*CTRL-W_CTRL-_* *CTRL-W__*
CTRL-W _	set current window height to N (default: highest possible)

z{nr}<CR>	set current window height to {nr}

You can also resize the window by dragging a status line up or down with the
mouse.  This only works if the version of Vim that is being used supports the
mouse and the 'mouse' option has been set to enable it.

The option 'winheight' ('wh') is used to set the minimal window height of the
current window.  This option is used each time another window becomes the
current window.  If the option is '0', it is disabled.  Set 'winheight' to a
very large value, e.g., '9999', to make the current window always fill all
available space.  Set it to a reasonable value, e.g., '10', to make editing in
the current window comfortable.

When the option 'equalalways' ('ea') is set, all the windows are automatically
made the same size after splitting or closing a window.  If you don't set this
option, splitting a window will reduce the size of the current window and
leave the other windows the same.  When closing a window, the extra lines are
given to the window above it.

The option 'cmdheight' ('ch') is used to set the height of the command-line.
If you are annoyed by the |hit-return| prompt for long messages, set this
option to 2 or 3.

If there is only one window, resizing that window will also change the command
line height.  If there are several windows, resizing the current window will
also change the height of the window below it (and sometimes the window above
it).

==============================================================================
7. Exiting Vim						*window-exit*

							*:qa* *:qall*
:qa[ll]		Exit Vim, unless there are some buffers which have been
		changed.  (Use ":bmod" to go to the next modified buffer).

:conf[irm] qa[ll]
		Exit Vim.  Bring up a prompt when some buffers have been
		changed.  See |:confirm|.

:qa[ll]!	Exit Vim.  Any changes to buffers are lost.

:wqa[ll]					*:wqa* *:wqall* *:xa* *:xall*
:xa[ll]		Write all changed buffers and exit Vim.  If there are buffers
		without a file name, which are readonly or which cannot be
		written for another reason, Vim is not quit.

:conf[irm] wqa[ll]
:conf[irm] xa[ll]
		Write all changed buffers and exit Vim.  Bring up a prompt
		when some buffers are readonly or cannot be written for
		another reason.  See |:confirm|.

:wqa[ll]!
:xa[ll]!	Write all changed buffers, even the ones that are readonly,
		and exit Vim.  If there are buffers without a file name or
		which cannot be written for another reason, Vim is not quit.

==============================================================================
8. Writing with multiple buffers			*buffer-write*

							*:wa* *:wall*
:wa[ll]		Write all changed buffers.  Buffers without a file name or
		which are readonly are not written.

:wa[ll]!	Write all changed buffers, even the ones that are readonly.
		Buffers without a file name are not written.

==============================================================================
9. argument and buffer list commands			*buffer-list*

      args list		       buffer list	   meaning ~
1. :[N]argument [N]	11. :[N]buffer [N]	to arg/buf N
2. :[N]next [file ..]	12. :[N]bnext [N]	to Nth next arg/buf
3. :[N]Next [N]		13. :[N]bNext [N]	to Nth previous arg/buf
4. :[N]previous	[N]	14. :[N]bprevious [N]	to Nth previous arg/buf
5. :rewind		15. :brewind		to first arg/buf
6. :last		16. :blast		to last arg/buf
7. :all			17. :ball		edit all args/buffers
			18. :unhide		edit all loaded buffers
			19. :[N]bmod [N]	to Nth modified buf

  split & args list	  split & buffer list	   meaning ~
21. :[N]sargument [N]   31. :[N]sbuffer [N]	split + to arg/buf N
22. :[N]snext [file ..] 32. :[N]sbnext [N]      split + to Nth next arg/buf
23. :[N]sNext [N]       33. :[N]sbNext [N]      split + to Nth previous arg/buf
24. :[N]sprevious [N]   34. :[N]sbprevious [N]  split + to Nth previous arg/buf
25. :srewind		35. :sbrewind		split + to first arg/buf
26. :slast		36. :sblast		split + to last arg/buf
27. :sall		37: :sball		edit all args/buffers
			38. :sunhide		edit all loaded buffers
			39. :[N]sbmod [N]	split + to Nth modified buf

40. :args		list of arguments
41. :buffers		list of buffers

The meaning of [N] depends on the command:
 [N] is number of buffers to go forward/backward on ?2, ?3, and ?4
 [N] is an argument number, defaulting to current argument, for 1 and 21
 [N] is a buffer number, defaulting to current buffer, for 11 and 31
 [N] is a count for 19 and 39

Note: ":next" is an exception, because it must accept a list of file names
for compatibility with Vi.


The argument list and multiple windows
--------------------------------------

The current position in the argument list can be different for each window.
Remember that when doing ":e file", the position in the argument list stays
the same, but you are not editing the file at that position.  To indicate
this, the file message (and the title, if you have one) shows
"(file (N) of M)", where "(N)" is the current position in the file list, and
"M" the number of files in the file list.

All the entries in the argument list are added to the buffer list.  Thus, you
can also get to them with the buffer list commands, like ":bnext".

:[N]al[l][!] [N]				*:al* *:all* *:sal* *:sall*
:[N]sal[l][!] [N]
		Rearrange the screen to open one window for each argument.
		All other windows are closed.  When a count is given, this is
		the maximum number of windows to open.
		When the 'hidden' option is set, all buffers in closed windows
		become hidden.
		When 'hidden' is not set, and the 'autowrite' option is set,
		modified buffers are written.  Otherwise, windows that have
		buffers that are modified are not removed, unless the [!] is
		given, then they become hidden.  But modified buffers are
		never abandoned, so changes cannot get lost.
		Buf/Win Enter/Leave autocommands are not executed for the new
		windows here, that's only done when they are really entered.

:[N]sa[rgument][!] [N]				*:sa* *:sargument*
		Short for ":split | argument [N]": split window and go to Nth
		argument.  But when there is no such argument, the window is
		not split.

:[N]sn[ext][!] [file ..]				*:sn* *:snext*
		Short for ":split | [N]next": split window and go to Nth next
		argument.  But when there is no next file, the window is not
		split.

:[N]spr[evious][!] [N]				*:spr* *:sprevious*
:[N]sN[ext][!] [N]				*:sN* *:sNext*
		Short for ":split | [N]Next": split window and go to Nth
		previous argument.  But when there is no previous file, the
		window is not split.

						*:sr* *:srewind*
:sr[ewind][!]	Short for ":split | rewind": split window and go to first
		argument.  But when there is no argument list, the window is
		not split.

						*:sla* *:slast*
:sla[st][!]	Short for ":split | last": split window and go to last
		argument.  But when there is no argument list, the window is
		not split.

==============================================================================
10. Tag or file name under the cursor			*window-tag*

							*:sta* *:stag*
:sta[g][!] [tagname]
		Does ":tag[!] [tagname]" and splits the window for the found
		tag.  See also |:tag|.

CTRL-W ]					*CTRL-W_]* *CTRL-W_CTRL-]*
CTRL-W CTRL-]	Split current window in two.  Use identifier under cursor as a
		tag and jump to it in the new upper window.  Make new window N
		high.

							*CTRL-W_g]*
CTRL-W g ]	Split current window in two.  Use identifier under cursor as a
		tag and perform ":tselect" on it in the new upper window.
		Make new window N high.

							*CTRL-W_g_CTRL-]*
CTRL-W g CTRL-]	Split current window in two.  Use identifier under cursor as a
		tag and perform ":tjump" on it in the new upper window.  Make
		new window N high.

							*:pta* *:ptag*
:pta[g][!] [tagname]
		Does ":tag[!] [tagname]" and shows the found tag in a
		"Preview" window without changing the current buffer or cursor
		position. If a "Preview" window already exists, it is re-used
		(like a help window is).  If a new one is opened,
		'previewheight' is used for the height of the window.   See
		also |:tag|.
		Example:				*CursorHold-example*
>   au! CursorHold *.[ch] nested exe "ptag " . expand("<cword>")
		This will cause a ":ptag" to be executed for the keyword under
		the cursor, when the cursor hasn't moved for the time set with
		'updatetime'.  The "nested" makes other autocommands be
		executed, so that syntax highlighting works in the preview
		window.  Also see |CursorHold|.  Note: this isn't perfect, you
		will get error messages when the cursor rests on a word that
		isn't a tag.

CTRL-W z					*CTRL-W_z*
CTRL-W CTRL-Z					*CTRL-W_CTRL-Z* *:pc* *:pclose*
:pc[lose][!]	Close any "Preview" windows currently open.  When the 'hidden'
		option is set, or when the buffer was changed and the [!] is
		used, the buffer becomes hidden (unless there is another
		window editing it).  The command fails if any "Preview" buffer
		cannot be closed.  See also |:close|.

							*:pp* *:ppop*
:[count]pp[op][!]
		Does ":[count]pop[!]" in the preview window.  See |:pop| and
		|:ptag|.  {not in Vi}

CTRL-W }						*CTRL-W_}*
		Use identifier under cursor as a tag and perform a :ptag on
		it. Make the new Preview window (if required) N high.  If N is
		not given, 'previewheight' is used.

CTRL-W g }						*CTRL-W_g}*
		Use identifier under cursor as a tag and perform a :ptjump on
		it. Make the new Preview window (if required) N high.  If N is
		not given, 'previewheight' is used.

CTRL-W f					*CTRL-W_f* *CTRL-W_CTRL-F*
CTRL-W CTRL-F	Split current window in two.  Edit file name under cursor.
		Like ":split ]f", but window isn't split if the file does not
		exist.
		Uses the 'path' variable as a list of directory names where to
		look for the file.  Also the path for current file is
		used to search for the file name.
		If the name is a hypertext link that looks like
		"type://machine/path", only "/path" is used.
		If a count is given, the count'th matching file is edited.
		Not available when the |+file_in_path| feature was disabled at
		compile time.

Also see |CTRL-W_CTRL-I|: open window for an included file that includes
the keyword under the cursor.

==============================================================================
11. Using hidden buffers				*buffer-hidden*

A hidden buffer is not displayed in a window, but is still loaded into memory.
This makes it possible to jump from file to file, without the need to read or
write the file every time you get another buffer in a window.

							*:buffer-!*
If the option 'hidden' ('hid') is set, abandoned buffers are kept for all
commands that start editing another file: ":edit", ":next", ":tag", etc.  The
commands that move through the buffer list sometimes make the current buffer
hidden although the 'hidden' option is not set.  This happens when a buffer is
modified, but is forced (with '!') to be removed from a window, and
'autowrite' is off or the buffer can't be written.

You can make a hidden buffer not hidden by starting to edit it with any
command.  Or by deleting it with the ":bdelete" command.

							*hidden-quit*
When you try to quit Vim while there is a hidden, modified buffer, you will
get an error message and Vim will make that buffer the current buffer.  You
can then decide to write this buffer (":wq") or quit without writing (":q!").
Be careful: there may be more hidden, modified buffers!

:files						*:files*
:buffers					*:buffers* *:ls*
:ls		Show all buffers.  Example:

>			1 #h  "/test/text"		line 1
>			2  -  "asdf"			line 0
>			3 % + "version.c"		line 1

		Each buffer has a unique number.  That number will not change,
		so you can always go to a specific buffer with ":buffer N" or
		"N CTRL-^", where N is the buffer number.

		'-' indicates a buffer that is not loaded.  'h' indicates a
		hidden buffer: It is loaded, but currently not displayed in a
		window.  '%' indicates the buffer in the current window.  '#'
		indicates the alternate buffer for ":e #" or CTRL-^.  '+'
		indicates a modified buffer.

						*:bad* *:badd*
:bad[d]	[+lnum] {fname}
		Add file name {fname} to the buffer list, without loading it.
		If "lnum" is specified, the cursor will be positioned at that
		line when the buffer is first entered. Note that other
		commands after the + will be ignored.

:[N]bd[elete]					*:bd* *:bdel* *:bdelete*
:bd[elete] [N]
		Unload buffer [N] (default: current buffer) and delete it from
		the buffer list.  If the buffer was changed, this fails.  The
		file remains unaffected.  Any windows for this buffer are
		closed.  If buffer [N] is the current buffer, another buffer
		will be displayed instead.  This is the most recent entry in
		the jump list that points into a loaded buffer.

:[N]bdelete!
:bdelete! [N]
		Unload buffer [N] (default: current buffer) and delete it from
		the buffer list.  If the buffer was changed the changes are
		lost.  The file remains unaffected.  Any windows for this
		buffer are closed.  If buffer [N] is the current buffer,
		another buffer will be displayed instead.  This is the most
		recent entry in the jump list that points into a loaded
		buffer.


:bdelete[!] {bufname}
		Like ":bdelete[!] [N]", but buffer given by name.  Note that a
		buffer whose name is a number cannot be referenced by that
		name; use the buffer number instead.  Insert a backslash
		before a space in a buffer name.

:N,Mbdelete[!]	do ":bdelete[!]" for all buffers in the range N to M
		(inclusive).

:bdelete[!] N1 N2 ...
		do ":bdelete[!]" for buffer N1, N2, etc.  The arguments can be
		buffer numbers or buffer names (but not buffer names that are
		a number).  Insert a backslash before a space in a buffer
		name.

:[N]bun[load]					*:bun* *:bunload*
:bun[load] [N]
		Unload buffer [N] (default: current buffer).  The memory
		allocated for this buffer will be freed.  The buffer remains
		in the buffer list.  If the buffer was changed, this fails.
		Any windows for this buffer are closed.  If buffer [N] is the
		current buffer, another buffer will be displayed instead.
		This is the most recent entry in the jump list that points
		into a loaded buffer.

:[N]bunload!
:bunload! [N]
		Unload buffer [N] (default: current buffer).  The memory
		allocated for this buffer will be freed.  The buffer remains
		in the buffer list.  If the buffer was changed, the changes
		are lost.  Any windows for this buffer are closed.  If buffer
		[N] is the current buffer, another buffer will be displayed
		instead.  This is the most recent entry in the jump list that
		points into a loaded buffer.

:bunload[!] {bufname}
		Like ":bunload[!] [N]", but buffer given by name.  Note that a
		buffer whose name is a number cannot be referenced by that
		name; use the buffer number instead.  Insert a backslash
		before a space in a buffer name.

:N,Mbunload[!]	do ":bunload[!]" for all buffers in the range N to M
		(inclusive).

:bunload[!] N1 N2 ...
		do ":bunload[!]" for buffer N1, N2, etc.  The arguments can be
		buffer numbers or buffer names (but not buffer names that are
		a number).  Insert a backslash before a space in a buffer
		name.

:[N]b[uffer][!] [N]					*:b* *:bu* *:buffer*
		Edit buffer [N] from the buffer list.  If [N] is not given,
		the current buffer remains being edited.  See |:buffer-!| for
		[!].

:[N]b[uffer][!] {filename}
		Edit buffer for {filename} from the buffer list.  See
		|:buffer-!| for [!].

:[N]sb[uffer] [N]					*:sb* *:sbuffer*
		Split window and edit buffer [N] from the buffer list.  If [N]
		is not given, the current buffer is edited.  Respects the
		"useopen" setting of 'switchbuf' when splitting.

:[N]sb[uffer] {filename}
		Split window and edit buffer for {filename} from the buffer
		list.

							*:bn* *:bnext*
:[N]bn[ext][!] [N]
		Go to [N]th next buffer in buffer list.  [N] defaults to one.
		Wraps around the end of the buffer list.  See |:buffer-!| for
		[!].
		If you are in a help buffer, this takes you to the next help
		buffer (if there is one). Similarly, if you are in a normal
		(non-help) buffer, this takes you to the next normal buffer.
		This is so that if you have invoked help, it doesn't get in
		the way when you're browsing code/text buffers. The next three
		commands also work like this.

							*:sbn* *:sbnext*
:[N]sbn[ext] [N]
		Split window and go to [N]th next buffer in buffer list.
		Wraps around the end of the buffer list. Uses 'switchbuf'

:[N]bN[ext][!] [N]			*:bN* *:bNext* *:bp* *:bprevious*
:[N]bp[revious][!] [N]
		Go to [N]th previous buffer in buffer list.  [N] defaults to
		one.  Wraps around the start of the buffer list.  See
		|:buffer-!| for [!] and 'switchbuf'.

:[N]sbN[ext] [N]			*:sbN* *:sbNext* *:sbp* *:sbprevious*
:[N]sbp[revious] [N]
		Split window and go to [N]th previous buffer in buffer list.
+		Wraps around the start of the buffer list. Uses 'switchbuf'.

							*:br* *:brewind*
:br[ewind][!]	Go to first buffer in buffer list.  See |:buffer-!| for [!].

							*:sbr* *:sbrewind*
:sbr[ewind]	Split window and go to first buffer in buffer list.
		Respects 'switchbuf' option.

							*:bl* *:blast*
:bl[ast][!]	Go to last buffer in buffer list.  See |:buffer-!| for [!].

							*:sbl* *:sblast*
:sbl[ast]	Split window and go to last buffer in buffer list.
		Respects 'switchbuf' option.

:[N]bm[odified][!] [N]					*:bm* *:bmodified*
		Go to [N]th next modified buffer in buffer list.

:[N]sbm[odified] [N]					*:sbm* *:sbmodified*
		Split window and go to [N]th next modified buffer in buffer
		list.  Respects 'switchbuf' option.

:[N]unh[ide] [N]			*:unh* *:unhide* *:sun* *:sunhide*
:[N]sun[hide] [N]
		Rearrange the screen to open one window for each loaded buffer
		in the buffer list.  When a count is given, this is the
		maximum number of windows to open.

:[N]ba[ll] [N]					*:ba* *:ball* *:sba* *:sball*
:[N]sba[ll] [N]	Rearrange the screen to open one window for each buffer in
		the buffer list.  When a count is given, this is the maximum
		number of windows to open.  Buf/Win Enter/Leave autocommands
		are not executed for the new windows here, that's only done
		when they are really entered.

Note: All the commands above that start editing another buffer, keep the
'readonly' flag as it was.  This differs from the ":edit" command, which sets
the 'readonly' flag each time the file is read.
