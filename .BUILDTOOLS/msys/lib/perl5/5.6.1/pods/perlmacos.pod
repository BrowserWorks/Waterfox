=head1 NAME

README.macos - Perl under Mac OS (Classic)


=head1 SYNOPSIS

This document briefly describes perl under Mac OS (Classic).
If you are running perl under Mac OS X, you don't want to be
here (unless you are in the Classic environment under Mac OS X).

When we say "Mac OS" below, we mean pre-Mac OS X, which includes
Mac OS 7, 8, and 9.


=head1 DESCRIPTION

The perl 5.6.1 source itself builds on Mac OS, with some additional
pieces. Support for Mac OS is now in the perl core, and MacPerl will be
able to, in the future, keep in closer sync with regular perl releases.

At this time, though, it is very buggy, and is under development.  An
alpha release is available, with work progressing toward a beta.

To build perl for Mac OS (as an MPW tool), you will need the addition
of the "macos" subdirectory, distributed separately.  It includes extra
source files, config files, and make files.  It also includes a lot of
extra Mac-specific modules.

To build the MacPerl application, you will also need the "macperl"
directory, which includes the source files for creating the
application itself.

All of this is available from the development site, via
HTTP and anonymous CVS.

	http://dev.macperl.org/

The source is also in the main perl repository in the maint-5.6/macperl
branch.

You will also need compilers and libraries, all of them freely
available.  These are linked to from the SourceForge site. Go that site
for all things having to do with MacPerl development.

MacPerl 5.2.0r4 is available on the CPAN and on SourceForge.  It
is based on perl 5.004.
