/**
 * The Shared Font List is a collection of data that lives in shared memory
 * so that all processes can use it, rather than maintaining their own copies,
 * and provides the metadata needed for CSS font-matching (a list of all the
 * available font families and their faces, style properties, etc, as well as
 * character coverage).
 *
 * An important assumption is that all processes see the same collection of
 * installed fonts; therefore it is valid for them all to share the same set
 * of font metadata. The data is updated only by the parent process; content
 * processes have read-only access to it.
 *
 * The total size of this data varies greatly depending on the user's installed
 * fonts; and it is not known at startup because we load a lot of the font data
 * on first use rather than preloading during initialization (because that's
 * too expensive/slow).
 *
 * Therefore, the shared memory area needs to be able to grow during the
 * session; we can't predict how much space will be needed, and we can't afford
 * to pre-allocate such a huge block that it could never overflow. To handle
 * this, we maintain a (generally short) array of blocks of shared memory,
 * and then allocate our Family, Face, etc. objects within these. Because we
 * only ever add data (never delete what we've already stored), we can use a
 * simplified allocator that doesn't ever need to free blocks; the only time
 * the memory is released during a session is the (rare) case where a font is
 * installed or deleted while the browser is running, and in this case we just
 * delete the entire shared font list and start afresh.
