 * Input events originate on the UI thread of the platform that this runs on,

 * for example, a touch move will usually lead to a panning of content (though
 * of course there are exceptions, such as if content preventDefaults the event,
 * or if the target frame is not scrollable). The compositor interacts with this
 * class by locking it and querying it for the current transform matrix based on
 * the panning and zooming logic that was invoked on the UI thread.

 * subframes) has its own AsyncPanZoomController. In the future, to support
