   *   use this event. This might be because it was directed at a point on
   *   the screen where there was no APZ, or because the thing the user was
   *   trying to do was not allowed. (For example, attempting to pan a
   *   non-pannable document).
   * nsEventStatus_eConsumeDoDefault is returned to indicate that the APZ
   *   code may have used this event to do some user-visible thing. Note that
   *   in some cases CONSUMED is returned even if the event was NOT used. This
   *   is because we cannot always know at the time of event delivery whether
