   * General handler for incoming input events. Manipulates the frame metrics
   * based on what type of input it is. For example, a PinchGestureEvent will
   * cause scaling. This should only be called externally to this class, and
   * must be called on the controller thread.
   *
   * This function transforms |aEvent| to have its coordinates in DOM space.
   * This is so that the event can be passed through the DOM and content can
   * handle them. The event may need to be converted to a WidgetInputEvent
   * by the caller if it wants to do this.
   *
   * The following values may be returned by this function:
   * nsEventStatus_eConsumeNoDefault is returned to indicate the
   *   APZ is consuming this event and the caller should discard the event with
   *   extreme prejudice. The exact scenarios under which this is returned is
   *   implementation-dependent and may vary.
   * nsEventStatus_eIgnore is returned to indicate that the APZ code didn't
   *   use this event. This might be because it was directed at a point on
   *   the screen where there was no APZ, or because the thing the user was
   *   trying to do was not allowed. (For example, attempting to pan a
   *   non-pannable document).
   * nsEventStatus_eConsumeDoDefault is returned to indicate that the APZ
   *   code may have used this event to do some user-visible thing. Note that
   *   in some cases CONSUMED is returned even if the event was NOT used. This
   *   is because we cannot always know at the time of event delivery whether
   *   the event will be used or not. So we err on the side of sending
   *   CONSUMED when we are uncertain.
   *
   * @param aEvent input event object; is modified in-place
   * @param aOutTargetGuid returns the guid of the apzc this event was
   * delivered to. May be null.
   * @param aOutInputBlockId returns the id of the input block that this event
   * was added to, if that was the case. May be null.
