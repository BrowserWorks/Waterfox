    Unset the ActiveTextureCache entry if the program does not reference it
    
    When changing uniforms of a program, State::onActiveTextureChange is
    called to update the ActiveTextureCache. If the sampler uniform type
    changes to TextureType::InvalidEnum, the entry in ActiveTextureCache was
    not cleared. This causes stale entries in ActiveTextureCache because the
    cache no longer matches what textures are bound and the cache does not
    add references to the textures in it.

    Use deviceContext instead of deviceContext1 (#24)
    
    Sometimes we don't have a deviceContext1 (on Win7) and would crash. We
    on't have any need to use it so just use deviceContext.

    Handle a null blend state. (#23)
    
    Null is used as the default blend state so we have to check for it.

    Don't use ClearView if we previously used dual source blending on Intel gen6. (#22)
    
    Doing a ClearView after a dual source blend seems to cause a TDR on
    Intel SandyBridge. Presumeably this is because the ClearView is
    implemented as a regular draw and the driver doesn't properly set up the
    state.
    
    If we detect that this is going to happen we fall back to the manual
    draw call path. This lets us use ClearView most of the time still.

    Restrict the slow texture upload workaround to 128bit formats. (#21)
    
    The workaround is slow for having a CPU-visible mirror of the texture, but that mirror is not properly recycled with regards to GPU usage, thus causing a CPU stall on update.
    
    Original reports were related to WebRender vertex texture updates that are RGBA32F and RGBA32U formats. Limiting the workaround to these formats would allow the affected platforms to upload regular texture data faster without stalls.

    Fix occasional corruption of vertex textures in HD4600 GPUs. (#19)
    
    This appears to be caused by the UpdateSubResource call,
    which is worked around by enabling the other image upload
    path that ANGLE supports.
    
    The workaround doesn't include a driver version, since the
    bug is occurring in the most recent driver that is currently
    available (15.40.42.5063, released 19th Mar 2019).

    Vulkan: Fix staging buffer alignment for pixel sizes > 4
    
    Previously, all non-compressed formats were satisfied with a 4-byte
    alignment.  The introduction of float formats changes this.
    
    This change calculates the necessary alignment using the same code path
    as compressed formats.
    
    Also fixes RGB9E5's pixelByte being calculated as 3 instead of 4.
