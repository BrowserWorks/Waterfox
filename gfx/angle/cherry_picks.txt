    Don't assert for non-sampleable non-ms sources in blitRenderbufferRect if we can CopySubResource.
    
    In Firefox, we can have a source from DirectComposition without
    D3D11_BIND_SHADER_RESOURCE. This is fine so long as our formats etc
    match enough to hit the CopySubResource path.

    Add ANGLE_TRANSLATOR_ESSL_ONLY instead of using build system logic to choose.
    
    Build system logic is really hard to handle when vendoring into Gecko for Firefox.

    Bug 1620075. Add a feature flag to allow ES3 on 10.0 devices. (#26)
    
    This lets us run WebRender on devices that only support D3D 10.0

    Don't use ClearView if we previously used dual source blending on Intel gen6. (#22)
    
    Doing a ClearView after a dual source blend seems to cause a TDR on
    Intel SandyBridge. Presumeably this is because the ClearView is
    implemented as a regular draw and the driver doesn't properly set up the
    state.
    
    If we detect that this is going to happen we fall back to the manual
    draw call path. This lets us use ClearView most of the time still.

    Restrict the slow texture upload workaround to 128bit formats. (#21)
    
    The workaround is slow for having a CPU-visible mirror of the texture, but that mirror is not properly recycled with regards to GPU usage, thus causing a CPU stall on update.
    
    Original reports were related to WebRender vertex texture updates that are RGBA32F and RGBA32U formats. Limiting the workaround to these formats would allow the affected platforms to upload regular texture data faster without stalls.
