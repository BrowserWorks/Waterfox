# This file is used to manage the ANGLE's dependencies in the Chromium src repo. It is
# used by gclient to determine what version of each dependency to check out, and
# where.
#
# These deps are duplicated in ANGLE's DEPS file which we use for the standalone
# build. The dual file setup is necessary because Chromium can only recurse into
# a single file and we do not want to import all of ANGLE's standalone DEPS.
#
# If you make a change to one of these dependencies please also update the
# standalone DEPS file.
