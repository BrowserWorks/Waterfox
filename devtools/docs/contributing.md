# Contributing

<!--TODO: make this less code focused and take ideas from debugger.html's contributing.md file-->

Thank you for taking the time to contribute!

Many people become contributors to implement a feature they miss, or want to fix something that annoys them. If you want to help, but don't know where to start, you could [look at our list of things to do](./bugs-issues.md). Alternatively, you might want to [report an issue or request a feature](./filing-good-bugs.md).

If it's your first time contributing, you should also read the documentation on [coding standards](./contributing/coding-standards.md). This might help you with questions such as what style of code to use, how to name new files (if you have to add any), tools we use to run automated checks, etc.

Once you think your work is ready to be shared, [learn how to make and submit a patch](./contributing/making-prs.md).

A member of the team will look at your contribution, and [perform a code review](./contributing/code-reviews.md).

* If all goes well, your patch will be merged into the project. Congratulations!
* If there are changes to be made, the reviewer will let you know, and you can send the updated patch again.
