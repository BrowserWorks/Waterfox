// Context encapsulates the main parameters of the current redux state, which
// impact most other information tracked by the debugger.
//
// The main use of Context is to control when asynchronous operations are
// allowed to make changes to the program state. Such operations might be
// invalidated as the state changes from the time the operation was originally
// initiated. For example, operations on pause state might still continue even
// after the thread unpauses.
//
// The methods below can be used to compare an old context with the current one
// and see if the operation is now invalid and should be abandoned. Actions can
// also include a 'cx' Context property, which will be checked by the context
// middleware. If the action fails validateContextAction() then it will not be
// dispatched.
//
// Context can additionally be used as a shortcut to access the main properties
// of the pause state.

// A normal Context is invalidated if the target navigates.
