/**
 * RequireJS configuration for JSON Viewer.
 *
 * ReactJS library is shared among DevTools. Both, the minified (production)
 * version and developer versions of the library are available.
 *
 * In order to use the developer version you need to specify the following
 * in your .mozconfig (see also bug 1181646):
 * ac_add_options --enable-debug-js-modules
 *
 * The path mapping uses paths fallback (a feature supported by RequireJS)
 * See also: http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#pathsfallbacks
 *
 * React module ID is using exactly the same (relative) path as the rest
 * of the code base, so it's consistent and modules can be easily reused.
