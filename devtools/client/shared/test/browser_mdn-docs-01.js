/**
 * This file tests the MdnDocsWidget object, and specifically its
 * loadCssDocs() function.
 *
 * The MdnDocsWidget is initialized with a document which has a specific
 * structure. You then call loadCssDocs(), passing in a CSS property name.
 * MdnDocsWidget then fetches docs for that property by making an XHR to
 * a docs page, and loads the results into the document. While the XHR is
 * still not resolved the document is put into an "initializing" state in
 * which the devtools throbber is displayed.
 *
 * In this file we test:
 * - the initial state of the document before the docs have loaded
 * - the state of the document after the docs have loaded
