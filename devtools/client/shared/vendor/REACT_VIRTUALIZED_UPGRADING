"react-virtualized" uses UMD style loading to work in many different environments.
It assumes that "react", "react-addons-shallow-compare", and "react-dom" are all included
separately via require statements. The paths to our installations are different.

If upgrading:

- Define the correct paths for React, etc and replace the require statements for the
  module.exports case with the correct paths.
- Replace any references to React.addons.shallowCompare with the webpack module id.
- To support use in XUL documents, replace calls to createElement with
  createElementNS("http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml", but make sure that you aren't replacing
  any calls to React.createElement.
- Also required for XUL, replace document.head and document.body with
  document.firstElementChild
