# The correct localization of this file might be to keep it in

# You want to make that choice consistent across the developer tools.
# A good criteria is the language in which you'd find the best

marker.gcreason.description.EAGER_ALLOC_TRIGGER=JavaScript returned to the event loop and there were enough bytes allocated since the last GC that a new GC cycle was triggered.
marker.gcreason.description.DESTROY_RUNTIME=Firefox destroyed a JavaScript runtime or context, and this was the final garbage collection before shutting down.
marker.gcreason.description.LAST_DITCH=JavaScript attempted to allocate, but there was no memory available. Doing a full compacting garbage collection as an attempt to free up memory for the allocation.
marker.gcreason.description.TOO_MUCH_MALLOC=JavaScript allocated too many bytes, and forced a garbage collection.

marker.gcreason.description.INCREMENTAL_TOO_SLOW=A full, non-incremental garbage collection was triggered because there was a faster rate of allocations than the existing incremental garbage collection cycle could keep up with.
marker.gcreason.description.COMPONENT_UTILS=Components.utils.forceGC() was called to force a garbage collection.
marker.gcreason.description.MEM_PRESSURE=There was very low memory available.

marker.gcreason.description.FULL_GC_TIMER=JavaScript returned to the event loop, and it has been a relatively long time since we performed a garbage collection.
marker.gcreason.description.SHUTDOWN_CC=Firefox destroyed a JavaScript runtime or context, and this was the final garbage collection before shutting down.
marker.gcreason.description.DOM_WINDOW_UTILS=The user was inactive for a long time. Took the opportunity to perform GC when it was unlikely to be noticed.
marker.gcreason.description.USER_INACTIVE=The user was inactive for a long time. Firefox took the opportunity to perform GC when it was unlikely to be noticed.
