 * Creates a ChromeWindowTargetActor for debugging a single window, like a browser window

 *
 * Currently this is parent process only because the root actor's `onGetWindow` doesn't
 * try to cross process boundaries.  This actor technically would work for both chrome and
 * content windows, but it can't reach (most) content windows since it's parent process
 * only.  Since these restrictions mean that chrome windows are the main use case for
 * this at the moment, it's named to match.
 *
 * Most of the implementation is inherited from BrowsingContextTargetActor.
 * ChromeWindowTargetActor exposes all target-scoped actors via its form() request, like
 * BrowsingContextTargetActor.
 *
 * You can request a specific window's actor via RootActor.getWindow().
 *
 * @param connection DevToolsServerConnection
 *        The connection to the client.
 * @param window DOMWindow
 *        The window.
