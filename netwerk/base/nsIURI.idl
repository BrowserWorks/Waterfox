/**
 * URIs are essentially structured names for things -- anything. This interface
 * provides accessors to set and query the most basic components of an URI.
 * Subclasses, including nsIURL, impose greater structure on the URI.
 *
 * This interface follows Tim Berners-Lee's URI spec (RFC3986) [1], where the
 * basic URI components are defined as such:
 * <pre>
 *      ftp://username:password@hostname:portnumber/pathname?query#ref
 *      \ /   \               / \      / \        /\       / \   / \ /
 *       -     ---------------   ------   --------  -------   ---   -
 *       |            |             |        |         |       |    |
 *       |            |             |        |      FilePath Query Ref
 *       |            |             |       Port       \            /
 *       |            |            Host      /          ------------
 *       |         UserPass                 /	              |
 *     Scheme                              /	             Path
 *       \                                /
 *        --------------------------------
 *                       |
 *                    PrePath
 * </pre>
 * The definition of the URI components has been extended to allow for
 * internationalized domain names [2] and the more generic IRI structure [3].

 * nsIURI - interface for an uniform resource identifier w/ i18n support.
 *
 * AUTF8String attributes may contain unescaped UTF-8 characters.
 * Consumers should be careful to escape the UTF-8 strings as necessary, but
 * should always try to "display" the UTF-8 version as provided by this
 * interface.
 *
 * AUTF8String attributes may also contain escaped characters.
 * 
 * Unescaping URI segments is unadvised unless there is intimate
 * knowledge of the underlying charset or there is no plan to display (or
 * otherwise enforce a charset on) the resulting URI substring.
 *
 * The correct way to create an nsIURI from a string is via
 * nsIIOService.newURI.
 *
 * NOTE: nsBinaryInputStream::ReadObject contains a hackaround to intercept the
 * old (pre-gecko6) nsIURI IID and swap in the current IID instead, in order
 * for sessionstore to work after an upgrade.  If this IID is revved further,
 * we will need to add additional checks there for all intermediate IIDs, until
 * ContentPrincipal is fixed to serialize its URIs as nsISupports (bug 662693).
