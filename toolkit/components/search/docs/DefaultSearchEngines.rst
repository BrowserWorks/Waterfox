Default Search Engines
======================

The search service specifies default search engines via the `configuration
schema`_.

Changing Defaults
=================

The default engine may change when:

* The user has the default engine set and the configuration for the locale/region
  changes.
* The user has the default engine set and their locale/region changes to one
  which has a different default.
* The user chooses to set a different engine via preferences.
* The user installs an add-on which sets its default as one of the application
  provided engines.
* The user installs an add-on which supplies a different engine and allows the
  different engine to be set as default.

Add-ons and App-provided Engines
--------------------------------

An add-on may set the name of the search provider in the manifest.json to be
the name of an app-provided engine. In this case:

* If the add-on is a non-authorised partner, then we set the user's default
  engine to be the name of the app-provided engine.
* If the add-on is from an authorised partner, then we set the users' default
  engine to be the same as the app-provided engine, and we allow the
  app-provided urls to be overridden with those of the add-on.

If the specified engine is already default, then the add-on does
not override the app-provided engine, and it's settings are ignored and no
new engine is added.

The list of authorised add-ons is stored in `remote settings`_ in the
`search-default-override-allowlist bucket`_. The list
includes records containing:

* Third-party Add-on Id: The identifier of the third party add-on which will
  override the app provided one.
* Add-on Id to Override: The identifier of the app-provided add-on to be
  overridden.
* a list of the url / params that are authorised to be replaced.

When an authorised add-on overrides the default, we record the add-on's id
with the app-provided engine in the ``overriddenBy`` field. This is used
when the engine is loaded on startup to known that it should load the parameters
from that add-on.

The ``overriddenBy`` annotation may be removed when:

* The associated authorised add-on is removed, disabled or can no longer be found.
* The add-on is no longer authorised or sets an unauthorised url.
* The user changes their default to another engine.
