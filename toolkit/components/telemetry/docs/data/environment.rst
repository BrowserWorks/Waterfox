Environment
===========

The environment consists of data that is expected to be characteristic for performance and other behavior and not expected to change too often.

Changes to most of these data points are detected (where possible and sensible) and will lead to a session split in the :doc:`main-ping`.
The environment data may also be submitted by other ping types.

*Note:* This is not submitted with all ping types due to privacy concerns. This and other data is inspected under the `data collection policy <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Data_Collection>`_.

Some parts of the environment must be fetched asynchronously at startup. We don't want other Telemetry components to block on waiting for the environment, so some items may be missing from it until the async fetching finished.
This currently affects the following sections:

- profile
- addons

build
-----

buildId
~~~~~~~
Firefox builds downloaded from mozilla.org use a 14-digit buildId. Builds included in other distributions may have a different format (e.g. only 10 digits).

Settings
--------

defaultSearchEngine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Note: Deprecated, use defaultSearchEngineData instead.

Contains the string identifier or name of the default search engine provider. This will not be present in environment data collected before the Search Service initialization.

The special value ``NONE`` could occur if there is no default search engine.

The special value ``UNDEFINED`` could occur if a default search engine exists but its identifier could not be determined.

This field's contents are ``Services.search.defaultEngine.identifier`` (if defined) or ``"other-"`` + ``Services.search.defaultEngine.name`` if not. In other words, search engines without an ``.identifier`` are prefixed with ``other-``.

defaultSearchEngineData
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Contains data identifying the engine currently set as the default.

The object contains:

- a ``name`` property with the name of the engine, or ``NONE`` if no
  engine is currently set as the default.

- a ``loadPath`` property: an anonymized path of the engine xml file, e.g.
  jar:[app]/omni.ja!browser/engine.xml
  (where 'browser' is the name of the chrome package, not a folder)
  [profile]/searchplugins/engine.xml
  [distribution]/searchplugins/common/engine.xml
  [other]/engine.xml

- an ``origin`` property: the value will be ``default`` for engines that are built-in or from distribution partners, ``verified`` for user-installed engines with valid verification hashes, ``unverified`` for non-default engines without verification hash, and ``invalid`` for engines with broken verification hashes.

- a ``submissionURL`` property with the HTTP url we would use to search.
  For privacy, we don't record this for user-installed engines.

``loadPath`` and ``submissionURL`` are not present if ``name`` is ``NONE``.

searchCohort
~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the user has been enrolled into a search default change experiment, this contains the string identifying the experiment the user is taking part in. Most user profiles will never be part of any search default change experiment, and will not send this value.

userPrefs
~~~~~~~~~

This object contains user preferences.

Each key in the object is the name of a preference. A key's value depends on the policy with which the preference was collected. There are two such policies, "value" and "state". For preferences collected under the "value" policy, the value will be the preference's value. For preferences collected under the "state" policy, the value will be an opaque marker signifying only that the preference has a user value. The "state" policy is therefore used when user privacy is a concern.

The following is a partial list of collected preferences.

- ``browser.search.suggest.enabled``: The "master switch" for search suggestions everywhere in Firefox (search bar, urlbar, etc.). Defaults to true.

- ``browser.urlbar.suggest.searches``: True if search suggestions are enabled in the urlbar. Defaults to false.

- ``browser.urlbar.userMadeSearchSuggestionsChoice``: True if the user has clicked Yes or No in the urlbar's opt-in notification. Defaults to false.

- ``browser.zoom.full`` (deprecated): True if zoom is enabled for both text and images, that is if "Zoom Text Only" is not enabled. Defaults to true. This preference was collected in Firefox 50 to 52 (`Bug 979323 <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=979323>`_).

attribution
~~~~~~~~~~~

This object contains the attribution data for the product installation.

Attribution data is used to link installations of Firefox with the source that the user arrived at the Firefox download page from. It would indicate, for instance, when a user executed a web search for Firefox and arrived at the download page from there, directly navigated to the site, clicked on a link from a particular social media campaign, etc.

The attribution data is included in some versions of the default Firefox installer for Windows (the "stub" installer) and stored as part of the installation. All platforms other than Windows and also Windows installations that did not use the stub installer do not have this data and will not include the ``attribution`` object.

sandbox
~~~~~~~

This object contains data about the state of Firefox's sandbox.

Specific keys are:

- ``effectiveContentProcessLevel``: The meanings of the values are OS dependent. Details of the meanings can be found in the `Firefox prefs file <https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/tip/browser/app/profile/firefox.js>`_. The value here is the effective value, not the raw value, some platforms enforce a minimum sandbox level. If there is an error calculating this, it will be ``null``.

partner
-------

If the user is using a partner repack, this contains information identifying the repack being used, otherwise "partnerNames" will be an empty array and other entries will be null. The information may be missing when the profile just becomes available. In Firefox for desktop, the information along with other customizations defined in distribution.ini are processed later in the startup phase, and will be fully applied when "distribution-customization-complete" notification is sent.

Distributions are most reliably identified by the ``distributionId`` field. Partner information can be found in the `partner repacks <https://github.com/mozilla-partners>`_ (`the old one <https://hg.mozilla.org/build/partner-repacks/>`_ is deprecated): it contains one private repository per partner.
Important values for ``distributionId`` include:

- "MozillaOnline" for the Mozilla China repack.
- "canonical", for the `Ubuntu Firefox repack <http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~mozillateam/firefox/firefox.trusty/view/head:/debian/distribution.ini>`_.
- "yandex", for the Firefox Build by Yandex.

system
------

os
~~

This object contains operating system information.

- ``name``: the name of the OS.
- ``version``: a string representing the OS version.
- ``kernelVersion``: an Android only string representing the kernel version.
- ``servicePackMajor``: the Windows only major version number for the installed service pack.
- ``servicePackMinor``: the Windows only minor version number for the installed service pack.
- ``windowsBuildNumber``: the Windows build number.
- ``windowsUBR``: the Windows UBR number, only available for Windows >= 10. This value is incremented by Windows cumulative updates patches.
- ``installYear``: the Windows only integer representing the year the OS was installed.
- ``locale``: the string representing the OS locale.

addons
------

activeAddons
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting from Firefox 44, the length of the following string fields: ``name``, ``description`` and ``version`` is limited to 100 characters. The same limitation applies to the same fields in ``theme`` and ``activePlugins``.

experiments
-----------
For each experiment we collect the ``id`` and the ``branch`` the client is enrolled in. Both fields are truncated to 100 characters and a warning is printed when that happens. This section will eventually supersede ``addons/activeExperiment``.
