/**
 * Tests the legacy case of a login store containing entries that have an empty
 * string in the formSubmitURL field.
 *
 * In normal conditions, for the purpose of login autocomplete, HTML forms are
 * identified using both the prePath of the URI on which they are located, and
 * the prePath of the URI where the data will be submitted.  This is represented
 * by the hostname and formSubmitURL properties of the stored nsILoginInfo.
 *
 * When a new login for use in forms is saved (after the user replies to the
 * password prompt), it is always stored with both the hostname and the
 * formSubmitURL (that will be equal to the hostname when the form has no
 * "action" attribute).
 *
 * When the same form is displayed again, the password is autocompleted.  If
 * there is another form on the same site that submits to a different site, it
 * is considered a different form, so the password is not autocompleted, but a
 * new password can be stored for the other form.
 *
 * However, the login database might contain data for an nsILoginInfo that has a
 * valid hostname, but an empty formSubmitURL.  This means that the login
 * applies to all forms on the site, regardless of where they submit data to.
 *
 * A site can have at most one such login, and in case it is present, then it is
 * not possible to store separate logins for forms on the same site that submit
 * data to different sites.
 *
 * The only way to have such condition is to be using logins that were initially
 * saved by a very old version of the browser, or because of data manually added
 * by an extension in an old version.
